<p class="noindent">Organization is how elements of information fit together to 
form a coherent arrangement of parts that makes sense to users. Organization 
applies both to the arrangement of two or more parts and to the arrangement of 
the information within each part. The parts that you organize range in size from 
the largest parts of the information set, such as an installation guide or a 
support website, to the smallest elements of information, such as field-level 
assistance in a user interface or an example in a step.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><strong>Figure 9.1</strong> The elements of an 
information set fit together to form larger organized parts that are presented

<p class="noindent">When you plan your writing at a high level, consider the 
organization of what you will produce from the top down. The <em>top-down 
perspective</em> is like an outline that shows how the main parts will be 
structured and how they relate to each other. You build your outline or topic 
model to ensure that you are planning to deliver the right content and that you 
have an idea of where each part goes. The completeness guideline “<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch05.html#ch05lev1sec3">Cover 
all subjects that support users’goals and only those subjects</a>” on page <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch05.html#ch05lev1sec3">115</a> 
provides guidance about planning the content that you need to write.</p>
<p class="noindent">The main parts should be laid out in a way that makes sense 
to users. For example, for a set of topics about installing a product, you need 
topics for planning, for prerequisites, and for installing, and the topics for 
planning need to be before the topics for installing.</p>
<p class="noindent">You organize the main parts into smaller elements, such as 
topics. In turn, topics contain organized paragraphs, lists, graphics, and other 
elements. Similarly, user interfaces contain organized windows, dialogs, and 
messages, which in turn contain organized tabs, fields, buttons, text, and 
labels. All of these elements are arranged to form the whole information 
set.</p>
<p class="noindent">The elements within each part must be arranged so that the 
structure of the part is clear to users. Well-organized content gives users an 
implicit sense of the <a id="page_321"></a>structure of the whole and of the 
parts. Users can then build expectations about where elements will be so that 
they can find what they need.</p>
<p class="noindent">To plan and write information that is effectively organized, 
be sure that each part, whether large or small, has its own coherent structure 
and fits well in the whole. To organize information well, follow these 
guidelines:</p>

<h3 id="ch09lev1sec1"><a id="page_322"></a>Put information where users expect 
it</h3>
<p class="noindent">An element of information, whether large or small, is in the 
right place when it’s in the first place that users look, or even better, when 
it’s right in front of users before they realize they need it.</p></div>
<p class="noindent">As discussed in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch01.html#ch01">Chapter 
1</a>, as technology evolves, technical information must adapt to keep up with 
the expectations of busy users and with changing information delivery 
mechanisms. The once-traditional set of bulky reference manuals and user guides 
gave way a long time ago to web-based information, which in turn has given way 
to information that is shorter and delivered right where it’s needed. 
Information might be delivered in many ways, such as:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• As part of users’ interactions in the user 
interface</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• In videos</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• On the box that a product is packaged in</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• On the installation screens</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• In a mobile device app</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• In topics on a website</p>
<p class="noindent">To exploit these methods of delivery and put information 
where users expect it, you need to organize information so that it can be 
delivered in smaller pieces.</p>
<div class="heading">
<div class="image"><a id="ch09fig02"></a><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%209%20Organization_files/09fig02.jpg" width="768" height="433" /></div>
<p class="fig-caption"><strong>Figure 9.2</strong> Information can be accessed 
from a multitude of devices or media, which are fed by an organized set of 
information elements</p></div>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_323"></a>An element of information might need to 
be small enough to fit on a mobile screen or in hover help, or it might be as 
large as an installation guide. Regardless, the element should be delivered 
where users expect it and provide the right information based on users’ needs. 
Any element or set of elements that is delivered in one place, such as an 
administration guide, a field on a website, or a message in a user interface, 
must have sufficient content to make sense in the context where users read it. 
Ensuring that the content is small enough to fit where it’s needed while still 
providing enough information for users is a bit of a balancing act.</p>
<p class="noindent">If you consider the number of elements that you might need 
to deliver the right content in the right places, the task of organizing your 
information into the necessary elements can seem overwhelming. A good way to 
start is by identifying which content is contextual and which is not 
contextual.</p>
<p class="head">Contextual information</p>
<p class="uln-indent">Information that is delivered in the user interface. 
Contextual information can be further separated into elements such as messages, 
labels, or contextual help topics based on where users need the information.</p>
<p class="head">Noncontextual information</p>
<p class="uln-indent">Information that is delivered outside the interface. This 
information includes content about the product overview, installation, and 
high-level tasks. Noncontextual information should be organized into topics that 
provide only what is needed. Each topic should be distinct from other topics so 
that it can be read by itself.</p>
<p class="noindent">As you write and organize the smaller elements of your 
information set, remember that:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Elements must be small enough to be delivered where 
users expect to find them.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Elements must have sufficient content to be 
meaningful when read alone.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Elements must be presented in a coherent arrangement 
of parts so that users know where to expect each element.</p>
<p class="noindent">An element is considered <em>discrete</em> if it is 
individually distinct and makes sense when delivered to users by itself. Topics 
and error messages are discrete elements because they can be read alone. 
Discrete elements can be delivered with other elements to form a larger part, 
but they are meant to be read one element at a time. In most cases, a paragraph 
is not a discrete element because it needs other paragraphs or context to make 
sense. Elements that are not meant to be delivered alone, such as paragraphs, 
must flow coherently with surrounding elements to convey ideas clearly.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_324"></a>To organize your content into discrete 
elements that are delivered where users expect, follow these guidelines:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB"><span class="middle"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%209%20Organization_files/squf.jpg" width="14" height="14" /></span><![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]><strong><a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch09.html#ch09lev2sec1">Separate

noncontextual information into discrete topics by type</a></strong></p>
<div class="heading">
<h4 id="ch09lev2sec1">Separate contextual information from other types of 
information</h4>
<p class="noindent">Contextual information explains the piece of the product 
that users are working with. For example, the arrows on the lid of a medicine 
bottle are contextual because they explain how to use the bottle lid. For 
software products, contextual information might explain product windows, fields, 
and controls. This information might include the syntax for a field, default 
values, conditions for when a control is available, what a control does, or what 
to do in a product window.</p></div>
<p class="noindent">Contextual information makes sense only “in context.” 
Contextual information that strays out of its context is in the wrong place. For 
a medicine bottle, the arrows are of little help if they are printed on the 
bottom of the bottle or shown on a website.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_325"></a>If you put contextual information with 
other types of information, such as user task topics or overview information, 
you waste resources because that information is not where users expect it. For 
example, the following explanation of a window and table of icons might add 
visual interest to a user’s guide, but it’s not helping users:</p>
<p class="rev-head">Original</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<hr />

<p class="title">Diagram pane</p>
<p class="sidebarpara">Use this pane to see descriptive information about a 
diagram and to change what elements can be displayed on the canvas. The Diagram 
pane contains two sections: Basic and Overview. The Overview section contains 
icons for the following actions.</p>
<div class="heading">
<div class="image"><a id="ch09tab1"></a><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%209%20Organization_files/325tab01.jpg" width="533" height="264" /></div>
<p class="tab-caption"><em>Table 1. The icons in the Overview 
section</em></p></div>
<hr />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Information that is in the wrong place or repeated 
unnecessarily is useless to your users. The information in the table is out of 
context in a user’s guide because it is useful only when users are working in 
the Overview section of a window. The information above the table is also 
contextual and arguably even more useless because users probably don’t want to 
memorize the names of the sections of the window they will use.</p>
<p class="rev-head"><a id="page_326"></a>Revision</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%209%20Organization_files/326fig01.jpg" width="667" height="212" /></div>
<p class="noindent">Users who want to know what a button does are likely to 
either hover over the button and look for a tooltip or try clicking the button 
to see what happens. They are much less likely to stop what they are doing and 
look for the button descriptions in the user’s guide. Because the table and 
explanation are not needed or expected in the user’s guide, they are removed in 
the revision. The contextual information is now available only in the user 
interface, where it belongs.</p>
<p class="noindent">When you add contextual information to noncontextual topics, 
you write a lot more content than is needed and put that content where it does 
users little good. In particular, avoid creating task topics that walk users 
through the elements of the windows or dialogs that are part of the task. As 
explained in the task orientation guideline “<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch03.html#ch03lev1sec3">Focus 
on users’ goals</a>” on page <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch03.html#ch03lev1sec3">32</a>, 
task topics should be higher level and focused on goals, not features or 
functions. If task topics contain contextual rather than goal-focused 
information, you get three unwelcome results:</p>
<p class="head">Information that is in the wrong place</p>
<p class="uln-indent">Contextual information for windows, dialogs, buttons, and 
fields is buried in task topics instead of provided in the interface. Users who 
try to use the interface don’t get the help they need where they need it.</p>
<p class="head">Information that is repeated unnecessarily</p>
<p class="uln-indent">Some windows might be used in multiple tasks, and 
low-level contextual steps for those windows are repeated in several user task 
topics. For example, suppose that users of your product log in infrequently and 
so often need to reset their passwords. If you add a step about how to reset a 
password to every user task for which users might need to log in, you will 
repeat that step many times out of context. A better approach is to add a 
<strong>Reset your password</strong> link to the login dialog.</p>
<p class="head"><a id="page_327"></a>Cluttered tasks</p>
<p class="uln-indent">Contextual information causes task topics to become 
cluttered. Many controls are just features and not required parts of any user 
tasks. In the previous example, the icons are features of a window in the 
product, but they aren’t really steps of a user task. When task topics serve as 
the only method of explaining the user interface, these topics will have 
extraneous steps for minor or unnecessary controls.</p>
<p class="noindent">Separating contextual information and keeping it separate is 
key to providing the right information in the right place. In practice, however, 
it’s not as easy as you might think. Time and again, contextual information will 
sneak into the wrong places, even when you have defined a clear organization 
scheme. Your organization scheme will likely be challenged by some typical 
situations:</p>
<p class="head">Application developers are unable to fix a defect, and the 
writer is asked to handle it in the documentation</p>
<p class="uln-indent">Suppose a mobile app shows wait times for attractions at 
an amusement park. Many users are frustrated because the app does not refresh 
the wait times frequently enough. A good solution is to have the app show the 
latest wait-time data or at least provide a prominent refresh button on the 
screen.</p>
<p class="uln-indent">A less desirable, but all too common, solution is to add a 
note to the app’s download page that reminds users about the hidden refresh 
button. This solution pretends to fix the problem, but instead it makes the 
problem worse. Because the download page is not where users expect to find 
information, users will continue to have the problem with the refresh button; 
however, now the real defect might never be fixed.</p>
<p class="head">Other teams, such as support or development, have assumptions 
about where content should be</p>
<p class="uln-indent">Removing contextual information from noncontextual places 
in your information set might initially be disruptive to support, development, 
or test teams. Suppose the support or development team is used to looking up 
connection properties in user’s guides for all products. These team members will 
be affected if those properties are now available only as choices on the 
connection dialog. The writer might be pressured to put those properties back in 
the user’s guide even though users need the properties only when they use the 
connection dialog.</p>
<p class="uln-indent">If the writer puts the content back in the user’s guide, 
the support team will be happier; however, the content in the user’s guide does 
not help users and is likely to become inconsistent with the properties in the 
dialog.</p>
<p class="head"><a id="page_328"></a>The marketing team wants to highlight new 
features in the documentation</p>
<p class="uln-indent">Suppose the marketing team wants to highlight a new import 
feature for a new release of an established product. The writer is asked to 
mention the new import feature everywhere possible, such as in high-level task 
topics, scenario and overview topics, and help topics for related windows. 
Although cluttering the documentation with advertisements about this import 
feature might satisfy the marketing team and would slightly improve the chances 
that users will learn about the existence of this feature, all of this extra 
clutter does not add value because the information is not where users expect to 
see it.</p>
<p class="uln-indent">The best way for the writer to help users with the new 
feature is to ensure that the feature works as expected and that any necessary 
contextual information is provided only where it is needed. In many cases, the 
new features list is probably the only noncontextual place where users would 
expect to see the new feature mentioned.</p>
<p class="noindent">Adding a note, step, paragraph, or sentence in the wrong 
place never helps users. Keep contextual information in context.</p>

<p class="noindent">The first revision no longer includes contextual information 
about buttons and fields on the web interface and on the mobile app. Information 
about where to go on the web interface to set up the account and payees is 
provided to make sure users get to the right web interface pages and have an 
idea what to do, but the other details aren’t provided. Users who go to the web

interface page and mobile app screen, which is where users need it and expect it 
to be. When users need to create payees, they can read the labels and text on 
the New Payee page if they need information. When users need to pay a bill, they 
can rely on the embedded assistance in the mobile app screen to understand how 
to pay <a id="page_332"></a>bills. You might notice that some of the labels do 
not match the labels that were mentioned in the original web page. Keeping 
contextual information in context provides an added advantage of requiring less 
maintenance for noncontextual content.</p>
<p class="noindent">Determine what information is contextual and provide that 
information separately from other information, such as higher level task or 
conceptual topics. Ensure that contextual information is available from the 
interface and not scattered in places that users do not expect to find it.</p>
<div class="heading">
<h4 id="ch09lev2sec2">Separate contextual information into the appropriate type 
of embedded assistance</h4>
<p class="noindent">As explained in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch05.html#ch05">Chapter 
5</a>, “<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch05.html#ch05">Completeness</a>,” 
contextual information is best presented in a consistent pattern that discloses 
information progressively to users. To develop a pattern for disclosing 
information, you need to take into account all of the information that users 
will need. This information, therefore, begins in the user interface as embedded 
assistance. The pattern should map a progression through the types of embedded 
assistance to assistance that is linked from the user interface and finally, if 
needed, to noncontextual information that you might deliver on the web.</p>
</div>
<div class="heading">
<div class="image"><a id="page_333"></a><a id="ch09fig03"></a><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%209%20Organization_files/09fig03.jpg" width="650" height="547" /></div>
<p class="fig-caption"><strong>Figure 9.3</strong> Application of a sample 
pattern with the following types of assistance shown: <strong>1.</strong> 
Default value, <strong>2.</strong> Label, <strong>3.</strong> Input hint, 
<strong>4.</strong> Static text for a field, <strong>5.</strong> Static text for 
the dialog, <strong>6.</strong> Hover help, <strong>7.</strong> Contextual help 
topic, <strong>8.</strong> Noncontextual topic</p></div>
<p class="noindent">Each user interface has different capabilities, but all user 
interfaces, even hardware products, include labels and messages. Well-designed 
user interfaces include some programmatic assistance, such as default or 
detected values. Some user interfaces have space for providing static 
descriptive text. Some provide capability for hover help or F1 help on fields 
and controls. Most user interfaces offer one or more mechanisms for displaying 
help: a single <strong><a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/gloss01.html#gloss_53">Help</a></strong> 
link in a banner, a <strong>Help</strong> menu choice, a <strong>Help</strong> 
push button in windows, or text links within the user interface.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_334"></a>If you consider all of the possible 
mechanisms for providing information, you can then determine what types of 
information elements you can provide with each mechanism in your pattern. For 
example, the label and message elements are always included in an interface, and 
so your pattern must include mechanisms to provide the label and message 
elements. The additional, optional mechanisms can provide elements such as 
description, syntax, context, or examples. So you might have a pattern with the 
following mechanisms for information elements:</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><strong>Figure 9.4</strong> Sample pattern for using 
mechanisms to progressively disclose contextual information elements in the user 
interface</p></div>
<p class="noindent">You can use the pattern to help you map where to put 
different types of content so that the content is delivered appropriately and 
users get what they expect. Some information elements work better when they are 
delivered in specific ways. For example, using hover help to present examples of 
long strings that users must enter is not effective because users cannot see the 
string as they type.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_335"></a>Follow the pattern consistently to 
ensure that the user experience is consistent across your set of products. If 
most windows and dialogs in an interface provide links to help topics from 
static text with the label <strong>Learn more</strong>, users are not likely to 
look for help links in other windows from a menu choice.</p>
<p class="rev-head">Original</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%209%20Organization_files/335fig01.jpg" width="722" height="404" /></div>
<p class="noindent">Users who use the original dialog must click the help button 
and read the explanation about what’s happening and instructions for what to 
do.</p>

<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%209%20Organization_files/335fig02.jpg" width="723" height="404" /></div>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_336"></a>In the first revision, some information 
about what to do is removed from the help and put where users can see it. 
However, to learn why the cardinality is needed and how to determine the 
cardinality, users must still access the help.</p>
<p class="rev-head">Second revision</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%209%20Organization_files/336fig01.jpg" width="722" height="405" /></div>
<p class="noindent">In the second revision, the embedded assistance in the 
dialog provides users with an explanation of what’s happening and what to do. 
The warning icons indicate a problem with the cardinality, and the hover help 
explains why the cardinality is needed. In addition, the dialog is altered so 
that users do not need to leave the task to run a script to calculate the 
cardinality for each table. Now they can calculate the cardinality without 
leaving the task. The help icon is removed because the help pane is no longer 
needed.</p>
<p class="noindent">When you create your pattern, keep in mind that each click 
that takes users away from the interface takes them further from their task. 
Always strive to keep the information that users need to complete a task as 
close to that task as possible. For example, the syntax for a complex value is 
probably most useful when it’s included as static text next to the field. If you 
include it as hover help, it’s slightly less useful, and if you include it in 
the help pane, it’s even less helpful.</p>
<div class="heading">
<h4 id="ch09lev2sec3"><a id="page_337"></a>Separate noncontextual information 
into discrete topics by type</h4>
<p class="noindent">Information is <em>noncontextual</em> if it can be 
understood outside the context of an interface. Noncontextual information 
includes overview, planning, installation, high-level task, concept, and 
reference information. This type of information might be delivered in HTML-based 
information sets, PDF or EPUB books, or other types of media. Although users 
might find noncontextual information by following a progressive disclosure path 
from an interface, they also expect to be able to find it by searching.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">Noncontextual information is easier to find and consume when 
it’s organized into distinct topics. Most users who search for a nugget of 
information, such as the syntax of a command, want to read about the syntax and 
move on. If you organize your noncontextual information into discrete topics, 
you will be able to:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Provide each topic in a format that can be searched 
for and delivered separately</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Combine related topics to form larger structures 
when needed</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Reuse topics in different places or for different 
audiences</p>
<div class="heading">
<h5 id="ch09lev3sec1">Topics</h5>
<p class="noindent"><em><a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/gloss01.html#gloss_152">Topics</a></em> 
are discrete, meaningful elements of information, each with a title and at least 
one paragraph that serves as an abstract or short description. A topic, also 
known as a chunk, article, or module, must be long enough to cover a subject 
adequately and make sense if read by itself.</p></div>
<p class="noindent">Well-organized information is easier for writers to reuse 
effectively for different types of output. By writing discrete topics that do 
not require a specific structure or linear arrangement, you enable the topics to 
be organized or reused in different ways. A single topic can appear in multiple 
topic sets, in multiple information centers, in a PDF or EPUB document, in a 
printed book, and on a website. You can also share topics across topic sets 
for:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Multiple product features</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Multiple operating systems</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Multiple audiences</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><strong>Figure 9.5</strong> Distinct topics contain 
paragraphs and other elements to adequately cover one subject. Topics can be 
organized into sets or delivered separately in different media.</p></div>
<p class="noindent">Organizing content into discrete topics gives you the 
flexibility to reuse the content or any portion of it for a variety of 
presentations. In addition, because topics are discrete and generally short, 
users who find the right topic will get just the information they need.</p>
<p class="noindent">The following list of topics shows a hierarchy of tasks in 
which the task of verifying the installation is combined with the task of 
configuring parameters:</p>
<p class="rev-head">Original</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%209%20Organization_files/338fig01.jpg" width="545" height="251" /></div>
<p class="noindent">The final topic is not discrete because the task of 
verifying installation is not part of the task of configuring parameters. One 
user might verify the installation while another user configures the parameters. 
In addition, users who need to configure additional parameters at some later 
time do not expect <a id="page_339"></a>to see steps for verifying the 
installation of a product that is already installed. The two tasks should not be 
combined into one topic.</p>
<p class="rev-head">Revision</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%209%20Organization_files/339fig01.jpg" width="545" height="300" /></div>
<p class="noindent">The revision shows verifying installation as the last 
discrete task at the same level as the other subtasks of installing the product. 
The revision allows for a logical separation of different tasks. Organizing the 
tasks into discrete topics might mean writing more topics, but it makes for a 
better user experience.</p>
<div class="heading">
<h5 id="ch09lev3sec2">Topic types</h5>
<p class="noindent">Each topic should generally contain only one type of 
information. Most technical information falls into one of three types:</p></div>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%209%20Organization_files/339tab01.jpg" width="687" height="411" /></div>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_340"></a>If you organize noncontextual 
information into topics by type, you can more easily keep topics discrete, and 
you can provide a consistent structure so that users know what to expect.</p>
<p class="noindent">For example, if all of the task topics contain a brief 
overview, prerequisites, steps, and postrequisites, users know what to expect in 
a task topic. If you add conceptual information to the steps, users who look for 
concepts will have a harder time finding that information, and users who are 
trying to do a task are interrupted by conceptual information. Similarly, users 
who look for syntax and examples of commands will have trouble locating the 
reference information if it is combined with concepts or tasks.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_343"></a>The revision shows three topics:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• “Union of multiple geometries,” a concept topic</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• “ST_Union function,” a reference topic</p>

the union of geometries</a>,” a task topic</p>
<p class="noindent">Users can find what they need quickly and don’t need to read 
through concepts to find tasks and syntax.</p>
<p class="noindent">Not every situation will call for one task, one concept, and 
one reference topic. For example, if the task of finding the union of geometries 
is a simple task that a user can do easily from the user interface, then you 
might need only a concept topic and a reference topic in the previous example. 
In other cases, you might need multiple reference topics or no concept topics or 
multiple task topics. The number and types of topics depend on the content and 
the audience.</p>
<p class="noindent">Organizing content by type provides a more flexible 
architecture that can accommodate change more easily. For example, if you create 
a separate topic for each task, you can easily add, remove, or rearrange tasks 
when the product changes or when you want to provide another organization scheme 
for a different set of users.</p>
<p class="noindent">Your company might provide templates for the three basic 
topic types as well as troubleshooting topics, error message topics, or even 
contextual help content. If you use DITA, templates for some topic types are 
provided for you. You can read more about concept, task, and reference topics in

<p class="fig-caption"><strong>Figure 9.6</strong> Topic sets can contain any

<p class="noindent">Although each topic should make sense on its own, most 
topics are delivered as part of one or more topic sets. Every topic set has a 
navigation scheme that indicates the hierarchy and relationships of the topics 
to each other. Suppose that you are documenting the task of creating custom 
reports. You know that users will want to read about the task as well as read 
the sample report reference topic and a set of concept topics about each type of 
report. You create a topic set that contains all of those topics and a hierarchy 
and order for the topics.</p>

<div class="heading">
<h3 id="ch09lev1sec2"><a id="page_345"></a>Arrange elements to facilitate 
navigation</h3>
<p class="noindent">If your information has a confusing structure or no 
discernible structure, users will have trouble navigating and using it. Ideally, 
you want the elements of any set of information to be arranged so well that 
users do not spend time having to think about the organization.</p></div>
<p class="noindent">When you arrange elements together, you help tell a story. 
Make sure that the right elements are presented together and that a hierarchy or 
structure is in place to help users find information and understand 
relationships.</p>
<p class="noindent">Elements in a topic, such as paragraphs, steps, or tables, 
must be arranged together in a coherent way, which might be according to 
sequence, a progression from general to specific, or a pattern for consistency 
with other similar topics.</p>
<p class="noindent">Elements in an interface should be arranged to facilitate 
understanding of user tasks and navigation through those tasks. The arrangement 
should also make clear the relationships of the smaller elements, such as fields 
and buttons, to a task and to each other.</p>
<p class="noindent">The following dialog is not arranged to aid navigation. Even 
if good labels and assistance are provided, users will have trouble knowing 
where to start and what to do because the structure of the dialog does not 
provide any clues about how actions or items are related.</p>
<div class="heading">
<div class="image"><a id="page_346"></a><a id="ch09fig08"></a><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%209%20Organization_files/09fig08.jpg" width="486" height="472" /></div>
<p class="fig-caption"><strong>Figure 9.8</strong> A dialog design with an 
unclear navigation. Users have no obvious starting point or clear idea of 
relationships.</p></div>
<p class="noindent">For topics, a topic map, navigation pane, or table of 
contents uses hierarchy and order to show relationships. The more topics you 
have, the more important it is to arrange them in a way that makes sense to 
users. When information is organized into unfamiliar, arbitrary, or ambiguous 
categories, users will feel lost and must work harder to find what they 
need.</p>
<p class="noindent">The organization of the following set of reference topics is 
based on the complexity of the information; however, this organization scheme 
assumes that users will know which topics are suited for beginners and which are 
suited for advanced users.</p>
<p class="rev-head"><a id="page_347"></a>Original</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%209%20Organization_files/347fig01.jpg" width="560" height="719" /></div>
<p class="noindent">In the original structure, topics are divided between 
beginner and advanced levels, so users must guess which category applies to the 
information they want to know. The division between the two branches is 
subjective and depends on users’ assessments of their own skill levels with the 
product. Some users might look for the topic “Prompted queries” under the 
Advanced branch, while other users could look for “Customizing the tutorial” 
under the Beginners branch.</p>
<p class="rev-head"><a id="page_348"></a>Revision</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%209%20Organization_files/348fig01.jpg" width="570" height="712" /></div>
<p class="noindent">In the revised structure, the topics are arranged into 
categories that make sense to all users.</p>
<p class="noindent">The order of topics within a category can indicate a logical 
progression based on various factors. For example, topics might be arranged in 
sequential order, in numerical or alphabetical order, from abstract to concrete, 
or even from most useful to least useful. If topics have no obvious sequential 
or categorical arrangement, you need to find other criteria for 
organization.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_349"></a>Suppose you have five topics that 
support the user task of monitoring performance. Your topic map might have a 
parent topic for the task and child topics that support the task or that contain 
subtasks. The following topic map shows a user task of monitoring performance 
with four subordinate topics: a concept topic, two reference topics, and one 
task topic.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%209%20Organization_files/349fig01.jpg" width="466" height="310" /></div>
<p class="noindent">In this topic set, users might not care much about the order 
of the child topics because only four child topics exist and these topics don’t 
seem sequential. Regardless of how these topics are arranged, users will have to 
scan through them to find what they want. In this case, although a different 
order might be just as reasonable, the writer arranged the topics in the order 
of usefulness for most users.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%209%20Organization_files/349fig02.jpg" width="623" height="414" /></div>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_350"></a>When an organization is obvious to 
users, information is easy to navigate. Just as a visitor to a home should 
expect to be able to find the dining room from the kitchen, users who browse any 
area of an information set should have a sense of where they are in the whole 
and how the current piece of information relates to the pieces around it.</p>
<p class="noindent">Information arrangement applies to more than just topics. 
Arrange all elements, whether they are paragraphs in a topic, topics in a set, 
or embedded assistance elements in a user interface, in a way that supports your 
users. To arrange information to help users navigate your content:</p>

<div class="heading">
<h4 id="ch09lev2sec4">Organize elements sequentially</h4>
<p class="noindent">The first experience users have with your content might be 
to evaluate the product for use and to gain an overview of the product’s 
capabilities. Later, users will need content that supports the task of 
installing or assembling the product, and then users will need content to 
support key tasks. Your organization scheme needs to support these primary uses, 
and your content should be organized to reflect the sequences of tasks.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">Because users generally complete key tasks in a certain 
order, the navigation should be arranged to reflect that order. If what users do 
in task Y depends on what they did in task X, the topics should be arranged so 
that task X precedes task Y.</p>
<p class="rev-head"><a id="page_351"></a>Original</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%209%20Organization_files/351fig01.jpg" width="539" height="425" /></div>
<p class="noindent">The original outline shows the task of configuring the 
connections following the task of testing the connections. In addition, the 
original outline shows the task of removing InfoProduct as a getting started 
task. Users are not likely to remove a product right after they install it, nor 
are they likely to look for the task of removing the product under the getting 
started branch.</p>
<p class="rev-head">Revision</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%209%20Organization_files/351fig02.jpg" width="549" height="364" /></div>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_352"></a>Users can’t test the connections until 
after they configure the connections, as shown in the revised outline. The 
revised outline does not include the removing task with the other getting 
started tasks.</p>
<p class="noindent">You also need to fit concept and reference topics into the 
outline in a way that makes sense to users. If concept and reference topics are 
associated with particular tasks, you can arrange these topics with the tasks 
and in an order that users would expect them or need to access them.</p>
<p class="noindent">A set of conceptual or reference topics might not belong 
with any particular task or might not fit well into a task structure. In these 
cases, you can arrange the topics for quick retrieval, such as alphabetically or 
numerically. With an alphabetical arrangement, whether in a book or in an 
information center, users know that the topic “Infolist command” is before the 
topic “Store command” and after the topic “Grant command.” Similarly, with a 
numerical arrangement, users know that message 120 is before message 395.</p>
<p class="noindent">A notable exception to the guideline to organize 
sequentially is window-level assistance, or contextual help topics. These topics 
are typically not organized together in any sequence because they are not meant 
to be read sequentially.</p>
<div class="heading">

<p class="noindent"><a id="page_353"></a>Organizing content sequentially is also 
important at the level of sentences and steps. If the information for a task is 
not presented in the order that users need it, users waste time and become 
frustrated.</p>

steps for usability</a>” on page <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch03.html#ch03lev2sec5">53</a> 
provides more information about organizing steps.</p>
<div class="heading">
<h4 id="ch09lev2sec5">Organize elements consistently</h4>
<p class="noindent">Similar content should be organized consistently across a 
product or a set of products. The organization of embedded assistance, the topic 
navigation, and even the contents of similar topics should be familiar to users 
and follow a consistent pattern.</p></div>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_355"></a>For a topic set, inconsistent 
navigation can be caused by either inconsistent content in topics or an unclear 
or ill-advised navigation scheme. When a topic set is organized inconsistently, 
some topics might be hidden or too hard to find in the navigation. In addition, 
any obvious inconsistencies look sloppy and can leave users wondering if content 
is missing, redundant, or wrong. For example, in the following navigation, the 
child topics are organized differently for each tag:</p>
<p class="rev-head">Original</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%209%20Organization_files/355fig01.jpg" width="739" height="313" /></div>
<p class="noindent">In the original navigation, it’s difficult to know whether 
all of the content is there and how it is organized for any one tag based on the 
organization of other tags. For example, each tag has content to explain the 
attributes for the tag:</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%209%20Organization_files/355tab01.jpg" width="687" height="175" /></div>
<p class="noindent">Users who look closely might find that the attributes are 
provided with the syntax for the Portlet tag and for the Filter tag.</p>
<p class="rev-head"><a id="page_356"></a>First revision</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%209%20Organization_files/356fig01.jpg" width="738" height="312" /></div>
<p class="noindent">In the first revision, the child topics are arranged in the 
same order for each tag, which makes additional organization inconsistencies 
more obvious. Users can see that the problem is not just in the order of the 
topics, but in the content of the topics themselves.</p>
<p class="noindent">Some tags are missing child topics or have combined child 
topics. For example, the syntax content is presented in three different 
ways:</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%209%20Organization_files/356tab01.jpg" width="687" height="174" /></div>
<p class="noindent">This inconsistency is now easy to spot in the navigation. 
Users can also see that not all tags have topics for their examples. It’s 
difficult to tell from this navigation whether examples for the Sort and Filter 
tags are available at all. And if they are available, which topic are they in? 
Users will have a hard time finding what they need in this inconsistent topic 
organization.</p>
<p class="rev-head"><a id="page_357"></a>Second revision</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%209%20Organization_files/357fig01.jpg" width="739" height="365" /></div>
<p class="noindent">In the second revision, the topics are organized 
consistently for each tag. Information is now separated into distinct topics so 
that the organization scheme is consistent. In addition, the examples topic is 
now the first child topic for each tag because users like to start with examples 
of tags and then look for more detail if needed. In this revision, the Filter 
tag and the Sort tag are each missing a topic about names because neither tag 
had content to support a names topic. Consistency does not require creating 
topics where none are warranted.</p>
<p class="noindent">In addition to these improvements, you can improve 
retrievability if you remove many of the redundant words from the child topic 
navigation titles. For example, the word <em>Menu tag</em> can be removed from 
navigation titles of the first three child topics under the Menu tag parent 
topic. See the retrievability guideline “<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch10.html#ch10lev2sec6">Optimize 
the table of contents for scanning</a>” on page <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch10.html#ch10lev2sec6">389</a> 
for information about facilitating scanning.</p>
<p class="noindent">The organization of elements within topics should follow a 
similar pattern across a product and other related products. For example, if you 
include restrictions before the steps in some task topics and after the steps in 
other task topics, users might not notice some of the restrictions. Similarly, 
if a quick start card for one product contains a link to a download page in the 
first line of the card, but the quick start card for a related product puts a 
link to a support page there instead, users might take a few wrong turns before 
finding the download page.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_358"></a>When you define a pattern to follow, 
ensure that your organization scheme is not too rigid. Consistent organization 
is good, but only when the patterns can accommodate new or changed content. 
Sometimes writers will try to get around strict organization schemes by 
inserting paragraphs that are marked as notes. If you find that some appropriate 
information is not fitting into your pattern or has no home, then you likely 
need a more flexible organization scheme.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, if you create a pattern for your embedded 
assistance and do not follow the pattern consistently, users might not get the 
information that they need. Suppose that you typically use hover help to provide 
assistance for fields that users need help with, but then you decide to provide 
field-level assistance for a few fields in a separate help pane. Users who are 
used to getting help in hover help are not likely to look in the help pane for 
those few fields. Those users are more likely to hover over the fields and 
assume that no information is provided.</p>
<p class="noindent">The following two screens of a mobile app show an 
inconsistent embedded assistance pattern. In one screen, the labels are embedded 
in the fields and descriptive text is above the labels; in the other screen, the 
field label is above the field, and descriptive text is in the field.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%209%20Organization_files/358fig01.jpg" width="650" height="461" /></div>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_359"></a>If you don’t follow an embedded 
assistance pattern consistently, you will likely have several screens that are 
not consistent. Eventually, you might find that one or more of your patterns is 
not working well. For example, the right screen in the example includes 
descriptive text in the field. If that text is complex, users might need it as 
they type but not be able to refer to it.</p>
<p class="noindent">Most people can relate to the frustration of not being able 
to find an account number on a statement or a phone number on a website because 
these appear in different places depending on the statement or the website. This 
type of inconsistency is less excusable within a product or related 
products.</p>
<p class="noindent">Consistent organization helps users become familiar with the 
structure of information so that they can find what they need with confidence. 
When you present information consistently, users learn to predict what 
information they will find and where they will find it.</p>
<div class="heading">
<h3 id="ch09lev1sec3"><a id="page_360"></a>Reveal how elements fit together</h3>
<p class="noindent">Because users do not read most information linearly, users 
need to understand where they are and where they can go. Like travelers, they 
need a map both at the beginning of a journey and as their trip progresses to 
keep their bearings in relation to the destination.</p></div>
<p class="noindent">For topics, the navigation pane or site map provides a map 
to those users who want a sense of the breadth of the information. However, if a 
navigation structure cannot provide sufficient information to help users 
understand key relationships, you should provide a better map for your 
users:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• You can provide task overview topics or content in a 
parent topic that shows how topics relate to each other. Users can return to 
these parent topics as necessary to link to other topics. In this way, users get 
a sense of the structure of the information and can read some of it linearly if 
they want to.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• You can add effective transitions with links that 
convey the relationships of topics to other topics in a topic set.</p>
<p class="noindent">These aids help users to verify their sense of the whole. If 
they can’t verify it or if a piece doesn’t fit, something is wrong or 
missing.</p>
<p class="noindent">Providing the topics and a navigation alone is often not 
enough. The following task topic is organized according to the order that users 
should do the subtasks or read the supporting topics, but it doesn’t convey how 
the pieces work together to make a whole.</p>

</div>
<p class="noindent">The revised topic shows the relationship of the subtasks to 
each other and to the higher-level task. The revised topic also mentions what to 
do after completing the task, so users are not left stranded.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_362"></a>The following parent topic doesn’t 
provide a “big picture” for the tasks that are involved in using the sample 
program:</p>
<p class="rev-head">Original</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%209%20Organization_files/362fig01.jpg" width="654" height="460" /></div>
<p class="noindent">The original set of topics includes a parent concept topic 
about the sample program with several child task topics and one child reference 
topic. Users cannot tell from the navigation pane whether the order of the child 
topics is important or how the tasks relate to each other. The parent topic in 
the right frame does not explain the relationships of the subtopics. Users are 
given a paragraph on the right and a set of disjointed topics, or unconnected 
dots, on the left.</p>
<p class="rev-head"><a id="page_363"></a>Revision</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%209%20Organization_files/363fig01.jpg" width="651" height="513" /></div>
<p class="noindent">The revised set of topics includes a parent task topic that 
explains that the first four subtopics are all subtasks of the parent task and 
indicates the order in which to do them. The parent task topic provides 
information about the subtopic relationships that users cannot grasp from the 
navigation pane alone. In the revision, the dots are now connected to form a 
picture of the parent task.</p>
<p class="noindent">Not all parent tasks require steps. Some parent tasks 
introduce the task, and users can choose the path that applies to them. Task 
overviews for a high-level goal might introduce and explain the goal in text 
format without using steps. The important thing is that these topics provide 
users with the big picture.</p>
<p class="noindent">Because topics are not always read linearly, you cannot 
assume that users have read topic A before reading topic B or that users who 
read topic A will know to go to topic B next. Therefore, introductions to tasks 
such as “Now that you have configured the receiver, you must configure the 
amplifier” are not sufficient. In the “Configuring the amplifier” topic, you 
need to mention that “Configuring the receiver” is a prerequisite task, and 
consider providing a link to the “Configuring the receiver” topic.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_364"></a>The same advice applies to other 
transitions between topics. Sentences such as “The next section explains how to 
configure the printer driver” assume that users see the sections in a certain 
order. A better way of mentioning a postrequisite task might be to provide a 
sentence like this in your topic: “After you complete this task, you must 
configure the printer driver.”</p>
<p class="noindent">The following passage shows the last step in a task topic 
that explains how to install a product:</p>

<p class="noindent">The revised topic explains to users that they can now 
configure their settings. The links to the related tasks are provided at the end 
of the topic for users who want to configure the settings now.</p>
<p class="noindent">For user interfaces, good user interaction design helps 
users keep their bearings. Labels, placement, and groupings in an interface 
provide users with a sense of relationships. Users can also keep their bearings 
with navigation aids such as <strong>Next</strong> and <strong>Back</strong> 
buttons.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_365"></a>In the following figure, the pages of 
the installation wizard are shown on the left and check marks indicate which 
pages are complete. Users can tell where they are in the task and where they are 
going.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%209%20Organization_files/365fig01.jpg" width="691" height="450" /></div>
<p class="noindent">See the retrievability guideline “Guide users through the 
iformation” on page 364 for more ways to help users keep their bearings.</p>
<div class="heading">
<h3 id="ch09lev1sec4"><a id="page_366"></a>Emphasize main points; subordinate 
secondary points</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use emphasis and subordination to distinguish main 
points from supporting information. Users need a way to distinguish the highways 
from the back roads so that they can keep track of the main points without 
getting diverted off course by secondary points.</p></div>
<div class="heading">
<h4 id="ch09lev2sec6">Main points</h4>
<p class="noindent">Emphasizing a main point involves one or more of the 
following techniques:</p></div>
<p class="head">Placement</p>
<p class="uln-indent">Placing key topics or words first is the best way to 
emphasize a main point: in the heading or title, in the introduction, at the top 
of a graphic, in the first sentence of a paragraph, in the first words of a 
sentence.</p>
<p class="head">Introduction</p>
<p class="uln-indent">An introduction, or overview, should make clear to users 
why subsequent information is important or how that information is relevant. 
Such an orientation places the subsequent information in context and therefore 
makes it easier for users to learn or to understand the order of content to 
come.</p>
<p class="uln-indent">For example, the main point of a topic should be made in 
the first paragraph. Users should be able to identify the main point immediately 
and determine if they are in the right topic, or in some cases, get all the 
information they need without having to read additional details.</p>
<p class="head">Repetition and reinforcement</p>
<p class="uln-indent">Repetition keeps users’ minds on the point throughout a 
topic or product interface. Effective reinforcement includes making a point in 
more than one way, such as by text and illustration, or by general statement and 
example.</p>
<p class="head">Details</p>
<p class="uln-indent">Details help emphasize what’s important. Users should be 
given more details about important information and fewer details about 
information that is less important.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_367"></a>The following paragraph seems to be 
about paragraphs at first:</p>
<p class="rev-head">Original</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<hr />

<p class="sidebarpara">Paragraphs can have their first lines indented or not; 
they can be set to the left margin or indented under headings; they can be 
separated by one blank line, two blank lines, or none. But, in the source, they 
all begin with a tag designating a paragraph. Similarly, a highlighted phrase 
can be underlined when it is printed on one device, appear in italic when 
printed on another, and display in red in a window. It is still the same kind of 
element, a highlighted phrase, identified by the same highlighting tag. 
Therefore, the generalized markup tag identifies the kind of element that a 
portion of a document is.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Users need to read the whole original paragraph to determine 
what the paragraph is about. Some users might not grasp the intended subject at 
all. The actual main point of the paragraph, how to use markup tags, is not 
introduced or reinforced.</p>
<p class="rev-head">First revision</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<hr />

<p class="sidebarpara">The generalized markup tag identifies the kind of element 
that a portion of a document is, not the way that the element is to be

be underlined when it is printed on one device, appear in italic when printed on 
another, and display in red in a window. It is still the same kind of element, a 
highlighted phrase, identified by a highlighting tag. Therefore, when marking a 
portion of a document, ask yourself, “What kind of element is this?” not “How do 
I want this to look?”</p>
<hr />
</div>
<p class="noindent">The first revised paragraph begins with the topic sentence. 
It uses repetition and contrast to emphasize the main point.</p>
<p class="rev-head"><a id="page_368"></a>Second revision</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<hr />

<p class="sidebarpara">The generalized markup tag identifies the kind of element 
that a portion of a document is, not the way that the element is to be 
formatted. For example:</p>
<p class="sb-indenthangingB">• Paragraphs are identified with a paragraph tag. 
They can be set to the left margin or indented under headings; they can be 
separated by one blank line, two blank lines, or none. But in the source, they

yourself, “What kind of element is this?” not “How do I want this to look?”</p>
<hr />
</div>
<p class="noindent">The second revision uses a list to set off the examples more 
clearly and make the information easier to scan. It also uses placement and 
reinforcement in the list items to keep the focus on the main point. The 
improved organization of the passage to emphasize the main point has improved 
the clarity of the passage as well. See the clarity guideline “<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch06.html#ch06lev1sec3">Write 
coherently</a>” on page <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch06.html#ch06lev1sec3">174</a> 
for a related discussion about using placement to emphasize ideas for better 
comprehension.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_369"></a>In websites or user interfaces, 
placement is often used to emphasize main points. The following welcome page 
shows one way that you can give more focus to some ideas and less to others:</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%209%20Organization_files/369fig01.jpg" width="762" height="471" /></div>
<p class="noindent">The main tasks in the window are shown on the left with 
extra details and larger icons, and related tasks and supporting links are shown 
on the right with no details and smaller icons. This window gives users access 
to several tasks, but it puts the most emphasis on the key tasks.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_370"></a>Introduction and grouping are other 
ways to reinforce main points and relationships in the interface. The following 
dialog shows a list of fields with no particular organization:</p>
<p class="rev-head">Original</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%209%20Organization_files/370fig01.jpg" width="697" height="489" /></div>
<p class="noindent">The original dialog treats all of the fields in the same 
manner and indicates no relationships between the fields.</p>

<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%209%20Organization_files/371fig01.jpg" width="550" height="469" /></div>
<p class="noindent">In the revision, the fields are grouped to show three main 
types of settings. The groupings and headings emphasize and introduce the three 
main outcomes that these settings can control. The emphasis that is provided by 
grouping the fields according to type gives users a sense of how the fields are 
related and makes the setting types easier to remember.</p>
<div class="heading">
<h4 id="ch09lev2sec7">Secondary points</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you give unwarranted emphasis to secondary information, 
you make that information seem more important than it is. Though a minor point 
might belong in the text, elaboration of the point probably does not.</p></div>

<p class="sb-indenthangingN"><strong>3.</strong> From the console, start 
recording by clicking <strong>Record test case</strong>, and then clicking 
<strong>Start.</strong></p>
<p class="sb-indenthangingNP">Instead of recording a test case, you can also 
import one from a different console. The import/export process involves four 
steps due to compatibility between devices. You would first save the test case 
in one console, and then export it to a second server. From the second server, 
you need to accept the import and then you can import the test case.</p>
<p class="sb-indenthangingN"><strong>4.</strong> Run the test case on the source 
device. Your actions are recorded along with the responses of the device. The 
recording is saved as a .rec file that you can access from any connected 
computer or device if you have an authorized user ID. However, the .rec file is 
not easy to read outside of the console.</p>
<p class="sb-indenthangingN"><strong>5.</strong> Click <strong>Replay</strong> 
and replay the test case on the target device. The test case is replayed, and 
the responses of the device are recorded in a .rec file that you can access from 
any connected computer or device. However, the .rec file is not easy to read 
outside of the console.</p>
<p class="sb-indenthangingNP">If you want to export this replayed test case, you 
can click <strong>Export</strong> and follow a four-step process.</p>
<p class="sb-indenthangingN"><strong>6.</strong> After the test case replays, 
click <strong>Compare</strong> to compare the responses from the two devices. 
You can see which device performs best or troubleshoot any commands that did not 
replay correctly.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<p class="noindent">The information about the import and export process is a 
minor point and probably not relevant to most users. Details about importing 
should be in a task about importing, not in a task for comparing a test case. 
Users don’t expect details about importing to be in a task about comparing and 
so will not know to look there.</p>
<p class="noindent">The original task topic also contains too much detail about 
errors that might occur and processes and files that users don’t care about. 
Users probably are interested to know that their actions are recorded, but they 
don’t need to know the file name of the recording and how to access it from 
outside the process.</p>

<p class="sidebarpara">To record, replay, and compare a test case on two 
devices:</p>
<p class="sb-indenthangingN"><strong>1.</strong> Clone the source device to the

settings from the source to the target manually.</p>
<p class="sb-indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> Open the InfoTest console at:

<p class="noindent">The revision includes a couple of minor points but does not 
go into detail. Information about the consequences of typing a password 
incorrectly is removed as well as all mention of importing and exporting files. 
Information is removed from two steps about the files that are saved because 
those details are not pertinent to the task. Consequently, the revision is much 
more streamlined and on task.</p>
<p class="noindent">For topics, web pages, and even user interface windows, be 
sure that secondary points do not appear in the first paragraph or at the 
top.</p>

<p class="title">What’s new in InfoProd V8</p>
<p class="sidebarpara">InfoProd is developed in parallel with InfoDB and is in 
use throughout the world across job functions, industries, and every InfoDB 
database platform and economy of scale.</p>
<p class="sidebarpara">Beginning with Version 6 the InfoProd features are all 
available for mobile devices, and now InfoProd V8 has new data visualization, 
solution-building, web-enablement, and solution-sharing capabilities.</p>
<p class="sidebarpara">Watch the video to see the new features.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_374"></a>The first paragraph is touting the 
product’s past accolades, which seems inconsistent with the main point of a page 
about what’s new. Even the second paragraph starts with old information.</p>
<p class="rev-head">Revision</p>

<p class="title">What’s new in InfoProd V8</p>
<p class="sidebarpara">InfoProd V8 has new data visualization, 
solution-building, web-enablement, and solution-sharing capabilities.</p>
<p class="sidebarpara">Watch the video to see the new features.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<p class="noindent">In the revision, the new features are mentioned first. Users 
do not have to read through the marketing text to pick them out.</p>
<p class="noindent">Using notes is a tempting way to insert new information into 
previously written topics, but notes generally interrupt the organization and 
hide the main point. If you use notes in this way, you’ll soon find that your 
topics have a lot of notes and no flow and that users can’t follow your main 
points. In the following passage, a note label is used to call attention to 
information that does not warrant special treatment:</p>
<p class="rev-head">Original</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<hr />

<p class="sidebarpara">You can cancel registrations if you no longer need to 
copy data or if the registration is erroneous. You can cancel only the 
registrations that you created.</p>
<p class="sidebarpara"><strong>Note:</strong> Canceling registrations ensures 
that the InfoDBase control tables are properly updated and prevents database 
errors.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<p class="noindent">The original passage gives unnecessary emphasis to the 
statement about the benefits of canceling a registration. That statement is not 
more important than the other two statements, yet the note label gives users the 
impression that it must be more important.</p>
<p class="rev-head"><a id="page_375"></a>Revision</p>
<div class="sidebar">

<p class="sidebarpara">You can cancel registrations if you no longer need to 
copy data or if the registration is erroneous. Canceling registrations ensures 
that the InfoDBase control tables are properly updated and prevents database 
errors. You can cancel only the registrations that you created.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<p class="noindent">In the revision, the information is added to the original 
paragraph and none of the sentences are rewritten. In addition, moving the 
sentence about which registrations users can cancel to the end of the paragraph 
improves the flow of the paragraph. The reasons and benefits of canceling 
registrations are covered first, followed by the restriction about which 
registrations can be canceled.</p>
<p class="noindent">Too many notes dilute the effectiveness of the note label to 
visually emphasize a point. Take the time to fit the new information into the 
existing structure, or reorganize the information to accommodate the new 
information.</p>
<p class="noindent">For more information about note labels and when to use them, 
see <em>The IBM Style Guide,</em> Chapter 3, “Notes and notices.”</p>
<div class="heading">
<h3 id="ch09lev1sec5"><a id="page_376"></a>Organization checklist</h3>
<p class="noindent">Organization is how pieces of information fit together to 
form a coherent arrangement of parts that makes sense to users.</p></div>
<p class="noindent">Organization deals with much more than how you arrange your 
topics. Well-organized information never leaves users feeling lost. Contextual 
information is provided where users expect it, and information is arranged so 
that it is easy to navigate. The order of tasks is clear, links and topic order 
suggest postrequisite tasks and lead users in the right direction, and the 
overall structure is always evident to users.</p>
<p class="noindent">You can use the following checklist in two ways:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• As a reminder of what to look for, to ensure a 
thorough review</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• As an evaluation tool, to determine the quality of 
the information</p>

characteristics, you can add your findings from this checklist to <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/app01.html#app01">Appendix
