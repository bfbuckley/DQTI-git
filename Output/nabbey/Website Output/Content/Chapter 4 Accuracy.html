                        <p class="noindent">As a writer of technical information, you have an important 
responsibility to provide information that is accurate and free of errors. Users 
depend on you for that accuracy; they stake their time and money on it. 
Achieving accuracy in technical information is an all-important goal, albeit a 
goal that isn’t easy to achieve.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">For technical information to be accurate, every piece of 
information must be accurate, including conceptual information, procedures, 
embedded assistance, legal disclaimers, screen captures, and illustrations.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">Inaccuracies might or might not be obvious. Those that 
aren’t obvious are often more significant because users might act based on 
inaccurate information.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">For example, imagine someone gives you driving directions 
that instruct you to turn right at the dead end. You immediately know that the 
directions are inaccurate because you can’t turn right at a dead end. Therefore, 
you take steps to resolve the inaccuracy, such as looking at a map or asking the 
person for clarification.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">Now imagine that someone gives you directions that instruct 
you to turn right at Front Street and to go straight until you cross the 
railroad tracks. You could drive for quite some time before realizing that no 
railroad tracks intersect <a id="page_68"></a>Front Street in the direction that 
you’re traveling, and that you were supposed to turn left instead of right. 
You’ll probably be more upset by the second set of directions than the 
first.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">In the article “Docs in the Real World,” Carolyn Snyder and 
Jared Spool recognize the importance of information accuracy when they coin the 
term <em>trust-breakers</em>. These are errors in information that cause users 
to avoid the information because they don’t trust it. Snyder and Spool make 
several observations about the effects of inaccuracies on users:</p>
                        <p class="uln-indent">Even small inaccuracies damage the confidence of some 
users, especially those users who don’t know how to work around the problem. 
When they discover an error, they tend to give up on the information and call 
the help desk.</p>
                        <p class="uln-indent">The information often takes the blame for inaccuracies in 
the underlying product or in related products. Users don’t care whose fault an 
error is; they are simply less willing to use the information in the future.</p>
                        <p class="uln-indent">After experiencing major problems in information, users 
are less likely to give the information another try, even in future 
releases.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">Regardless of how much time users take to detect an 
inaccuracy, their confidence in the information is eroded; they might even 
choose not to use the information or the product at all.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">To make information accurate, follow these guidelines:</p>

                            <h3 id="ch04lev1sec1"><a id="page_69"></a>Research before you write</h3>
                            <p class="noindent">Before you can tell users how to complete a task, you must 
understand why users need to perform the task in the first place, and you must 
understand each step in that task. Before you can explain a complicated 
technical concept, you must understand that concept yourself. Without a proper 
understanding of your subject, you risk writing information that is based on 
assumptions and misunderstandings.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p class="noindent">If you don’t understand your subject, the writing process 
can become an exercise in frustration because you don’t have all of the raw 
material that you need to complete your help topic, scenario, embedded 
assistance, or illustration. Technical reviews tend to be less productive 
because reviewers must spend valuable review time correcting fundamental 
mistakes and misstatements instead of making comments that can result in 
significant improvements. Information must be accurate before it can be 
effective.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">Although you need to understand the technical subject that 
you write about, you don’t need to understand it as well as the engineers who 
develop the product. In fact, if you understand the internal workings of the 
product too well, you risk losing the perspective of your users. A good balance 
is having enough understanding to be able to ask your technical experts relevant 
questions that users might ask, but not so much understanding that you think 
that you don’t need input from technical experts.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">In addition to researching technical subjects, you should 
spend time researching your audience. As explained in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch03.html#ch03">Chapter 
3</a>, “<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch03.html#ch03">Task 
orientation</a>,” a solid understanding of your audience and their goals is 
critical to providing the information that your users really need.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">To obtain the knowledge that you need to document a new or 
complex subject:</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingB">• Rely on hands-on experience to gain the knowledge 
that you need</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingB">• Create outlines, topic models, information plans, 
and rough drafts to help you identify what you know and what you don’t know</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingB">• Interview technical experts and domain experts</p>
                        <div class="heading">
                            <h4 id="ch04lev2sec1">Hands-on experience and direct observation</h4>
                            <p class="noindent">The best way to understand a technical subject that you 
write about is to use the product as a user would. The more that you can use a 
product, tool, or interface, the more responsible you can be for the accuracy of 
the information.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p class="noindent">For example, when you write a procedure that requires users 
to create a server profile so that applications can connect to a server, you can 
use the interface to <a id="page_70"></a>create your own server profile. In 
doing so, you determine which parts of the profile need to be documented. After 
you finish writing the procedure, you can ask your colleagues to test it; if 
they can successfully create a server profile by using the documentation that 
you wrote, you know that the procedure is accurate.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">When time and circumstances allow, use one or more of the 
following activities to ensure the accuracy and usefulness of your 
information:</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingB">• Participate in design review meetings. In addition 
to contributing embedded assistance where it is needed and ensuring that a 
progressive disclosure pattern is followed, you’ll be able to gain insight into 
how new functions will be used.</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingB">• Use prototypes to familiarize yourself with how a 
product, tool, or interface works. As an early user, you’re also likely to 
suggest changes that result in some design improvements.</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingB">• Set up an informal usability walkthrough in which 
you and your colleagues use the information to perform some or all of the 
important user tasks just as users will. Rely primarily on the embedded 
assistance, and consult topics only when necessary.</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingB">• Participate in formal usability walkthroughs in 
which users use the information to do certain tasks. Contribute questions that 
will help you to validate the information, such as:</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingNB">– Does a particular task topic include the correct 
prerequisite steps?</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingNB">– Do users need more detail about a particular set of 
input fields?</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingNB">– Will users understand a new term based on the 
current definition?</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingB">• Visit one or more of the users of your information 
to observe them as they do their day-to-day tasks.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">These kinds of activities increase your knowledge of how 
your users do their jobs so that you can develop accurate information that makes 
their jobs easier.</p>
                        <div class="heading">
                            <h4 id="ch04lev2sec2">Information plan, outline, and rough-draft reviews</h4>
                            <p class="noindent">Perhaps a product is not available for you to experience 
first hand, or technical experts are unable to explain the subject to you at the 
beginning of the writing cycle. Perhaps the design of major pieces of the 
product is still in flux. You must start with what you do understand to create 
information plans, outlines or topic models, and rough first drafts of 
topic-based information. Creating these <em>early cycle</em> documents is a good 
way to validate your assumptions, right and wrong.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p class="head"><a id="page_71"></a>Information plans</p>
                        <p class="uln-indent">Information plans are contracts between the people who 
write the information and the other groups who participate in the creation of 
the information, such as development, test, translation, and so on.</p>
                        <p class="uln-indent">In traditional development environments, information plans 
typically cover all the deliverables that will be created for a release cycle, 
the processes that will be followed, the schedule for producing the information, 
and the people who will be involved in writing, reviewing, translating, and 
publishing the information. In an information plan, you can list specific topics 
and embedded assistance content that you think need to be written and then have 
that list validated by reviewers of your plan.</p>
                        <p class="uln-indent">In agile development environments, there is no 
one-size-fits-all information plan. In fact, because of the ever-shifting nature 
of agile projects, an information plan might not even mention specific 
information deliverables. It might include sections such as a definition of the 
writing team’s role in the process, agreements between the writing team and the 
rest of the development team about how information will be authored and 
reviewed, and the processes that will be followed during the development cycle. 
However, as the development cycle progresses, you will likely need to create one 
or more plans to address the topics, embedded assistance, messages, and graphics 
that will be needed to support the release.</p>
                        <p class="head">Outlines and topic models</p>
                        <p class="uln-indent"><em>Outlines</em> represent the structure of information, 
whether that information is a single task or an entire library. Outlines help 
you to identify all the pieces of information that you need and to put those 
pieces in the right order.</p>
                        <p class="uln-indent"><em><a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/gloss01.html#gloss_153">Topic 
models</a></em> are a specific type of outline that shows the structure of 
topic-based information. To create a good topic model, start by identifying all 
of the goal-oriented user tasks and putting them in the most logical order. 
Then, determine the conceptual and reference information that is needed to 
support the tasks.</p>
                        <p class="head">Rough drafts</p>
                        <p class="uln-indent">Rough drafts are your starting point for writing the 
topics that support your product. During this information gathering phase, when 
you’re identifying the pieces that you need to write, work at a very high level. 
Don’t invest time in documenting details just yet. At this stage, your goal is 
simply to figure out which pieces of the puzzle you understand well enough to 
document and which pieces require more research before you can document 
them.</p>
                        <p class="noindent"><a id="page_72"></a>Include notes in your outlines, plans, 
and rough drafts to identify information that you understand, and include 
questions to get more information about gray areas.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">When you’ve gone as far as you can, you can do two things: 
you can start to document in detail the pieces that you do understand, and you 
can begin to solicit feedback from your technical experts on the pieces that you 
don’t understand. The notes and questions that you added to your outlines, 
plans, and drafts will help technical experts to focus on the areas that need 
the most attention. Continue to fine-tune your rough drafts, plans, and outlines 
until you have a complete understanding of the subject.</p>

                            <h4 id="ch04lev2sec3">Interviews</h4>
                            <p class="noindent">Even if you’re able to use the product extensively and 
participate in design and walkthrough activities, you will still likely need 
feedback from others to help ensure the accuracy of your information.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p class="noindent">Technical experts are your primary source to validate how 
product functions work, and domain experts are your primary source for 
information about how or why users need those product functions. You need both 
perspectives to produce truly outstanding technical information. Involve both of 
these resources early in the writing cycle to eliminate disruptive false starts 
and wrong turns, and rely on them throughout the writing cycle to keep you on 
track. A few minutes interviewing a knowledgeable technical or domain expert is 
often more valuable than hours of research on your own.</p>
                        <div class="heading">
                            <h3 id="ch04lev1sec2"><a id="page_74"></a>Verify the information that you 
write</h3>
                            <p class="noindent">A useful by-product of researching a subject before you 
write about it is that you get the raw information that you need, and you get it 
validated simultaneously. When a technical expert explains a concept to you, you 
can be reasonably sure that the explanation is accurate.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p class="noindent">However, the explanation that you got from one technical 
expert during the initial design phase might conflict with feedback that you 
receive from other technical experts later in the cycle. Early feedback from 
customers might result in changes to the product. Product functions and features 
often change, get added, or get removed in response to schedule and resource 
changes. To ensure the accuracy of the information for the finished product, you 
must verify that information throughout the development cycle.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">There are a number of ways to verify that information is 
accurate, including hands-on testing with nearly finished products, conducting 
formal technical reviews, and ensuring that your information is included in 
product testing.</p>
                        <div class="heading">
                            <h4 id="ch04lev2sec4">Hands-on testing with interfaces</h4>
                            <p class="noindent">Whenever possible, validate the embedded assistance that you 
write by using the actual product interface. There’s no substitute for seeing 
and interacting with the UI content that you write just as your users will.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p class="noindent">If you work in an agile development environment, you likely 
have opportunities to access the interface regularly. If you work in a 
traditional waterfall development environment, you might not be able to test the 
interface until late in the development cycle.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">In traditional waterfall development environments, early 
iterations of user interfaces are often buggy or are not functionally complete. 
You need to be sure that all functions are present and are working as designed 
before you spend time validating the information that supports those functions. 
However, you still need to give yourself time to fix any problems that you 
uncover before the product deadline.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">For example, after your team puts the finishing touches on 
the interface for your product, you devote some time to validating the embedded 
assistance that you added. One seemingly insignificant function that you haven’t 
validated yet is the dialog for changing passwords. You open the dialog, display 
the hover help, and proceed to change your password to your favorite food, 
<code>macandcheese</code>, which meets the criteria indicated in the hover 
help.</p>

ownership</h4>
                            <p class="noindent">Almost all technical writing projects involve some sort of 
technical review. Reviews can take place near the end of the development cycle 
or iteratively throughout the development cycle. Remember that putting your 
content out for review doesn’t necessarily mean that the outcome of that review 
will be completely accurate documentation. Technical reviews are effective only 
when reviewers do their job. Here are some tips to make your reviews more 
effective:</p>
                        </div>
                        <p class="head">Ensure that the right reviewers participate</p>
                        <p class="uln-indent">Typically, you know who the right people are: they are the 
technical experts whom you have developed a relationship with throughout the 
course of the project. However, don’t overlook the feedback that you can obtain 
from other stakeholders.</p>
                        <p class="uln-indent">For example, the people who work directly with customers 
in the field can often provide you with a more customer-centric perspective, 
which can help you make your information more usable. Your technical support 
team can be especially valuable reviewers of information about features or tasks 
that have a high incidence of support calls. They are also valuable reviewers of 
error messages and troubleshooting information because they deal with these 
types of content every day.</p>
                        <p class="head">Ensure that the reviewers focus on technical issues</p>
                        <p class="uln-indent">During reviews, technical experts sometimes get distracted 
by a missing comma or misspelled word, and they can’t restrain themselves from 
commenting. Although their intentions are good, you need them to validate the 
technical accuracy of the content. The following tips can help prevent a 
technical review from turning into a copy edit:</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingB">• Make sure your review draft is as error-free as 
possible before you ask technical reviewers to review it. If your draft doesn’t 
contain any distracting grammatical, spelling, or punctuation errors, reviewers 
are less likely to lose sight of their role in the review.</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingB">• When you send the draft to reviewers, provide 
guidelines for the review. For example, identify the specific content that you 
need reviewers to focus on. If the draft has not been edited, inform reviewers 
of this fact and tell them that the draft will be edited after the technical 
content is finalized.</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingB">• Use notes in the draft to help reviewers focus. Call 
their attention to individual sections or paragraphs that you need them to 
validate. Ask specific questions such as “In the following paragraph, are the 
restrictions for using the CHECK utility in a partitioned server environment 
complete and correct?”</p>
                        <p class="head"><a id="page_77"></a>Assign technical ownership</p>
                        <p class="uln-indent">Assigning technical ownership of specific pieces of 
information to specific people helps ensure accuracy by instilling a sense of 
accountability in your technical experts. Because technical owners are 
responsible for vouching for the accuracy of the information that you write, 
they’re likely to review the information thoroughly.</p>
                        <p class="uln-indent">To assign technical ownership, you need to identify 
technical experts to be responsible for the accuracy of some area of the 
information, for example, the configuration topics, performance-related content, 
or all of the information that is related to a particular feature. Match 
potential owners with their area of expertise, ask them to commit to being a 
technical owner, and then notify them of what is expected:</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingB">• They will need to review the information that they 
own to make sure that it’s accurate.</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingB">• If something isn’t accurate, they will need to work 
with you until it is accurate.</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingB">• They will need to formally sign off that the 
information is accurate by sending you a note or by adding a comment in your 
project tracking tool.</p>
                        <p class="uln-indent">Assign only one person per functional area so that there’s 
no confusion about who is responsible for reviewing the content and formally 
vouching for its accuracy.</p>
                        <p class="head">Identify exit criteria for the review</p>
                        <p class="uln-indent">Well-defined exit criteria, which are the criteria that 
must be met before a review can be closed, are essential for determining how 
effective a review was and for taking action when a review is inadequate. By 
adopting exit criteria into your normal review processes, you remove any 
question about what constitutes a completed review. You can also use the exit 
criteria to establish corrective actions when necessary. The following list 
shows some typical criteria for exiting a review:</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingB">• All mandatory reviewers thoroughly reviewed the 
draft and sent a note to the writer who conducted the review.</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingB">• All critical issues were addressed.</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingB">• Concrete plans were established to address any 
remaining open items:</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingNB">– A technical owner was assigned to each open 
item.</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingNB">– The technical owner agreed to the plan for 
resolving the item.</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingNB"><a id="page_78"></a>– A due date was established for 
each item.</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingNB">– A mitigation strategy was established if an item 
was not resolved by the due date.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">When the criteria that you assign are met, you can be 
confident that the review was effective.</p>
                        <div class="heading">
                            <h4 id="ch04lev2sec6">Information in quality control tests</h4>
                            <p class="noindent">Testers are responsible for making sure that the product is 
working as designed and is free from bugs, errors, and design flaws that might 
cause problems for your users. The information that you write is an important 
part of the product, so it makes sense to include your information as part of 
formal product testing.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p class="noindent">Ensure that your information is explicitly mentioned in test 
scripts and that testers use it to accomplish their testing. For example, make 
sure that test scripts include plans to validate the embedded assistance, 
including hover help, help text, error messages, and links to more information. 
Also, make sure that your quality control team uses your task topics when they 
install and configure the product.</p>
                        <div class="heading">

                            <p class="noindent">Information that’s not current is not accurate. Information 
can become outdated from one release to the next or even within a development 
cycle, and some types of information are more prone to becoming outdated than 
other types of information. For example, reference information tends to be 
rather static, whereas installation procedures tend to need regular upkeep with 
each new release.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p class="noindent">Technical information is susceptible to becoming out of date 
because technology is always changing and evolving. As a technical writer, you 
learn to accept, and even thrive on, this constant state of change. You 
anticipate that the interface, mobile app, or utility that you document today 
might look drastically different two years, or even two months, from now. Still, 
it can be difficult to make sure that everything you write stays as current as 
it needs to be.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">For example, when you work on a new release, you’re pretty 
good about adding new installation requirements and changing the description of 
how a utility works. But what about subtle changes, such as those to legal 
boilerplate information or trademarks? What about design changes that you aren’t 
informed of? And what about changes that get overlooked because nobody 
recognizes the dependency between one piece of information and another? How can 
you make sure that <em>all</em> of your information stays current?</p>
                        <p class="noindent">Maintaining information currency is a challenge, but the 
following guidelines can help:</p>

                            <p class="noindent">Making sure that the documentation stays in sync with 
product changes is one of the most important jobs for any technical writer. 
Users expect information to reflect the current state of the product.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p class="noindent">Big changes tend not to get overlooked. You’re not likely to 
neglect to document a major new scenario, task, or capability in the upcoming 
release. The changes that you need to watch out for are the ones that aren’t 
always apparent.</p>
                        <div class="heading">
                            <h5 id="ch04lev3sec1">Changes during a development cycle</h5>
                            <p class="noindent">Changes that occur between releases are usually obvious. 
After all, you’re expecting things to change from one release to the next. 
Product planners identify new scenarios and functions, and you start thinking 
about the new documentation that will be required. But changes can also occur 
during the <a id="page_80"></a>development cycle, after designs have been agreed 
on or after part of the product has presumably been finalized. These are the 
types of changes that tend to surprise you.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p class="noindent">For example, in a traditional waterfall development 
environment, you typically use technical specifications to start writing. 
However, technical specifications can get out of sync with the product, even if 
the team tracks changes to the specifications. Changes creep in, but they often 
don’t get communicated to all the team members who are affected by them.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">In an agile development environment, where requirements and 
designs can change from one iteration to the next, you must be a regular 
participant in the design review process to stay current with changes as they 
occur.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">For example, accuracy problems can result when you include 
graphics that show all or part of the user interface if the interface changes 
after the information is finalized. Assume that your writing team created a 
viewlet that shows users how to create steps in a process flow. The following 
window, which was designed based on the technical specification, plays a 
prominent role in the viewlet:</p>
                        <div class="image">
                            <img alt="Image" src="Chapter 4 Accuracy_files/080fig01.jpg" width="550" height="378" />
                        </div>
                        <p class="noindent"><a id="page_81"></a>After the technical specification was 
written, however, the visual design team updated several of the icons in the 
palette, and the development team added a new icon to the palette. 
Unfortunately, word of these changes never made it to the writing team. The 
window that they included in the viewlet is now inaccurate. This problem is not 
limited to the viewlet. Task steps and embedded assistance that mention the 
contents of the palette are now also out of sync with the window. Ensure that 
information about the interface is current and that it matches what users will 
see and experience.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">Attend design meetings, familiarize yourself with 
prototypes, or install iterations of the product as they become available 
throughout the development process so that you can compare the latest interface

                            <h5 id="ch04lev3sec2">Changes to existing messages</h5>
                            <p class="noindent">One type of information that gets overlooked in terms of 
currency is product messages. During information reviews, typically only new 
messages get reviewed, which means that older messages that become obsolete or 
inaccurate because of new changes often go undetected. For example, the 
following message accompanied version 5.1 of a product:</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="image"><a id="page_82"></a>
                            <img alt="Image" src="Chapter 4 Accuracy_files/081fig01.jpg" width="603" height="325" />
                        </div>
                        <p class="noindent">However, the product function changed in version 5.2, as 
indicated in this review comment:</p>
                        <div class="sidebar">
                            <hr width="100%" size="0" align="center" />
                            <p class="title"><strong>Comment - FDavis:</strong> This message does not apply 
to v5.2.</p>
                            <p class="sidebarpara">Deployment profiles were removed after v5.1. Also, users 
can no longer use the configuration tool to set the content element 
property.</p>
                            <hr width="100%" size="0" align="center" />
                        </div>
                        <p class="noindent">Luckily, the writer included all of the product messages in 
the review and a diligent reviewer picked up on this change. Now the writer can 
determine whether this message is obsolete and should be removed or if it is 
still valid and needs to be updated to reflect the current behavior. The writer 
can also search all of the version 5.2 content for instances of <em>deployment 
profile</em> and <em>content element property</em> and address any other 
potential inaccuracies.</p>

                            <h4 id="ch04lev2sec8">Avoid writing information that will become outdated</h4>
                            <p class="noindent">You might think that the content that you write will provide 
value to your users indefinitely. Technology, however, has other ideas. The 
content that you write today might be outdated only several months later. 
Fortunately, some techniques can help you increase the lifespan of your 
content.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p class="noindent">One technique is to avoid referring to features and 
functions as <em>new</em>. New is always a temporary state. Not only should you 
avoid explicitly using the term <em>new</em> to refer to a new feature, 
function, or component, you should avoid associating a feature, function, or 
component with a particular release. The only valid exception to this rule is 
when you write marketing information or <em>what’s new</em> information whose 
sole purpose is to highlight the features of a new release of a product.</p>
                        <p class="noindent"><a id="page_83"></a>The following table provides some 
examples for eliminating problematic constructions:</p>
                        <div class="image">
                            <img alt="Image" src="Chapter 4 Accuracy_files/083tab01.jpg" width="687" height="345" />
                        </div>
                        <p class="noindent">Another technique for prolonging the life of your 
information is to avoid referring to specific releases except when necessary. 
For example, the following web page provides general information about the 
InfoDBase product:</p>
                        <p class="rev-head">Original</p>
                        <div class="image">
                            <img alt="Image" src="Chapter 4 Accuracy_files/083fig01.jpg" width="647" height="365" />
                        </div>
                        <p class="noindent">Specifying the release number for a product might be 
accurate for this release, but references to the release number will become 
inaccurate if they’re not changed in the next release. If a statement about a 
product will be true in future releases, write the statement in a general 
way.</p>
                        <p class="rev-head"><a id="page_84"></a>Revision</p>
                        <div class="image">
                            <img alt="Image" src="Chapter 4 Accuracy_files/084fig01.jpg" width="647" height="365" />
                        </div>
                        <p class="noindent">Some information, however, does require you to specify 
version and release details, so don’t unilaterally stop referring to specific 
versions and releases. For example, you would likely find it impossible to 
document how to upgrade from one release to another without mentioning specific 
release information. Restrictions are another area where release-specific 
references might be needed, for example, “<strong>Restriction:</strong> The 
DBMON command is not supported by InfoDBase V4R1.” Use your judgment to 
determine when it’s appropriate to include references to specific product 
releases.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">Also, be careful about including dates in graphics, 
examples, or code samples, especially in information that will likely not be 
updated frequently. Even if the information is still valid ten years later, 
users might suspect that the information is outdated based on a date, and they 
might waste time searching for a more current version of the information, which 
doesn’t exist. For example, the following sample report, which is included in a 
reference topic, includes several dates:</p>
                        <p class="rev-head">Original</p>
                        <div class="image">
                            <img alt="Image" src="Chapter 4 Accuracy_files/084fig02.jpg" width="661" height="229" />
                        </div>
                        <p class="noindent"><a id="page_85"></a>Although these dates were current when 
the topic was written, reference information is often not updated regularly. 
Unless the dates are critical for users to understand the content, consider 
taking a more generic approach.</p>
                        <p class="rev-head">Revision</p>
                        <div class="image">
                            <img alt="Image" src="Chapter 4 Accuracy_files/085fig01.jpg" width="661" height="229" />
                        </div>
                        <p class="noindent">In the revision, specific dates have been replaced with 
generic variables that won’t ever go out of date, and the specific times have 
been replaced for the sake of consistency. The version identifier has also been 
replaced because the original value of 410 can become outdated as new versions 
and releases are introduced.</p>

                            <h3 id="ch04lev1sec4"><a id="page_86"></a>Maintain consistency in all 
information about a subject</h3>
                            <p class="noindent">Many accuracy problems occur when information about a 
subject is not consistent in all of the places where that subject is mentioned. 
For example, users read a task scenario that describes how to set a group of 
parameters to achieve a performance goal; however, the reference topics for 
those parameters provide a different set of valid values than the values that 
are mentioned in the task scenario. Faced with inconsistent information, users 
don’t know which instance of the information is correct.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p class="noindent">Maintaining consistency across all of the information for a 
product or technology isn’t easy, especially on large teams where different 
people are responsible for different parts of the product. Therefore, you need 
to be both proactive and diligent to ensure that your information is consistent. 
The following guidelines can help you achieve that goal:</p>

                        </p>
                        <div class="heading">
                            <h4 id="ch04lev2sec9">Reuse information when possible</h4>
                            <p class="noindent">Content that is reused in multiple information deliverables 
should be written once and maintained in a common location or in a shared file 
that is reused whenever it is needed. Writing a single version of reused content 
reduces the potential for inaccuracies and inconsistencies across different 
deliverables and reduces the amount of maintenance that is required to keep the 
content current. If your information is translated, reusing information also 
reduces translation costs because reused information needs to be translated only 
once.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p class="noindent">The simplest form of information reuse involves copying the 
information from one place and pasting it somewhere else. Choose this technique 
only if the reused information is very short, is reused in only two or three 
places, and is unlikely to change in the future.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">For longer pieces of information that you do not want to 
copy verbatim, use a better approach for reuse: single sourcing. <em>Single 
sourcing</em> refers to the use of the same source, with few or no changes, for 
different outputs. Unless otherwise noted, the word <em>reuse</em>, when used in 
this book, refers to the use of a single source of information, not to the 
copying of information.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">Methods for reusing content vary by authoring tool, but most 
tools offer some mechanism for reusing content easily. Depending on the 
authoring tool that you use, the method might be text insets, text entities, 
shared files, file entities, building blocks, or content references.</p>
                        <p class="noindent"><a id="page_87"></a>For example, you can use a single 
sentence in multiple places, such as in a topic in an HTML- or XML-based 
information set, in a printed document, and in embedded assistance. Rather than 
wasting your time synchronizing multiple copies of the same information, you can 
spend your time ensuring that the sentence is clear, accurate, and relevant for 
each deliverable that includes it.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">The following figure shows how you might reuse a note in 
four separate pieces of information:</p>
                        <div class="image">
                            <img alt="Image" src="Chapter 4 Accuracy_files/087fig01.jpg" width="699" height="448" />
                        </div>
                        <p class="noindent">When updates are required, you can make the change in one 
place—the source text—rather than updating multiple copies of the text. The next 
time that you generate output, the changes will be implemented 
automatically.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">Product and component names are a prime candidate for reuse 
because they tend to be ubiquitous in technical information and because they 
tend to change over time. When the name of a product or component changes, it’s 
much easier to update that name once in a shared file and have that update 
automatically propagate across all of your files than it is to search and 
replace the name in every file that is part of an information set.</p>
                        <p class="noindent"><a id="page_88"></a>Other types of content that are good 
candidates for reuse include:</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingB">• Legal boilerplate text that must be the same in all 
of your organization’s publications</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingB">• A task step that is common to several different 
tasks</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingB">• Lengthy commands, parameters, and environment 
variables that are duplicated in multiple topics</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingB">• Message text that is used in both the product 
interface and in a published message reference</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingB">• Version and release identifiers that need to be 
changed as new versions and releases become available</p>
                        <p class="noindent">Not only does using a single source improve the accuracy of 
information, but it also eliminates the time that is needed to synchronize 
similar information. For more information about information reuse, see the style 
guideline “<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch08.html#ch08lev2sec12">Commonly

                            <p class="noindent">Inconsistencies can occur when similar or related 
information is used in multiple places and the different instances of that 
information are not kept in sync. Inconsistencies ultimately lead to 
confusion.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p class="noindent">When you follow a recipe that starts with “Preheat the oven 
to 325°” and ends with “Bake at 375° for 40 minutes,” you don’t know which 
temperature is correct, and you risk overcooking or undercooking your meal.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">Inconsistencies that can indicate or cause accuracy problems 
include:</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingB">• Names or titles are incorrect, for example:</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingBD">– The content of a figure or table doesn’t match its 
caption or surrounding text.</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingBD">– Topic titles don’t accurately describe the content 
of the topic.</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingBD">– The column headings of a table are inconsistent 
with or don’t accurately reflect the actual content of the column’s cells.</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingB">• Field labels, hover help, tooltips, static text, and 
messages in the user interface do not match the names that are used in related 
help or task topics.</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingB">• The format of syntax elements in reference 
information does not match the format used elsewhere. For example, the date 
format of <em>yyyymmdd</em> is used in a reference topic, but the date format of 
<em>mmddyyyy</em> is used in related task topics.</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingB"><a id="page_89"></a>• Information in marketing 
collateral, such as on a website or in a trade show brochure, isn’t consistent 
with the related technical information.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">The best way to avoid introducing inconsistencies is by 
reusing single-sourced information in multiple places. However, not all related 
information is a viable candidate for single-sourcing. Therefore, you must 
proactively synchronize related information that can’t be single-sourced 
automatically.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">Sometimes you need to include technical information in more 
than one place, often in more than one format. For example, perhaps you provide 
sample database tables with your product. One of those sample tables, Employee, 
contains data about employees:</p>
                        <div class="heading">

                            <hr width="100%" size="0" align="center" />
                        </div>
                        <p class="noindent">The revised passage accurately lists all four employees in 
the department; the example is consistent with the sample table and is therefore 
accurate.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">The original example might have become inconsistent with the 
sample table for various reasons. Perhaps this is just an attention-to-detail 
error. Perhaps the sample table was changed after the examples were created. Or 
perhaps writing assignments changed, and the new writer was unaware of the 
dependency between the examples and the sample table. Regardless of the cause of 
this inconsistency, you can take steps to reduce the chance of inconsistencies 
finding their way into your documentation.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">A good practice for keeping track of these types of 
dependencies is to insert comments into the source for your topics (if your 
authoring tool allows) or into a separate history file for your project. This 
practice is especially helpful on large projects with many writers and many 
different but related topics.</p>
                        <p class="noindent"><a id="page_92"></a>For example, consider the preceding 
situation in which the command output was inconsistent with the Employee sample 
table. In this case, the inconsistency might have been avoided if the source for 
the sample Employee table contained a note about the dependency. When writers 
change the sample Employee table, they know to also change the dependent 
examples in topics.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">Another practice that can help you maintain the consistency 
of related information is to ask yourself each time that you update information: 
“Should I make other changes as a result of this one?” Follow up by searching 
your information set for potential related changes. This exercise is valuable 
because it causes you to consider other areas of the information that you might 
otherwise not think about.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">For example, in the upcoming release of your product, you 
learn that valid values for the TIMEOUT parameter will be changed from 1-240 to 
1-360. You update the reference topic for the TIMEOUT parameter accordingly, and 
then you search the product library for the string “TIMEOUT.” Not surprisingly, 
you find other areas of the documentation that are affected by this change: a 
tip and several messages that instruct users to set the TIMEOUT parameter to 
240. By identifying and making these changes, you’ve prevented your users from 
becoming confused, and you’ve saved your organization money by preventing 
support calls from users wondering what the correct settings are for the TIMEOUT 
parameter.</p>

                            <h3 id="ch04lev1sec5"><a id="page_93"></a>Use tools that automate checking for 
accuracy</h3>
                            <p class="noindent">Spelling, grammar, punctuation, and typographical errors are 
typically thought of as style defects, and problems with links are most closely 
associated with retrievability defects. However, these types of problems can 
also affect the accuracy of the information.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p class="noindent">Spelling, grammar, punctuation, and typographical errors can 
have a variety of effects. When users notice a minor error, their overall 
satisfaction with the information might decline slightly. If they notice many 
errors, they might question the overall accuracy of the technical information. 
If the errors are inaccuracies in code examples, procedures, statements of valid 
values, or syntax definitions—inaccuracies that result in significant 
problems—users are likely to lose confidence in the documentation and turn 
elsewhere for their information. They might even contact your support team, 
which ends up costing your company money. Similarly, broken links are a sign of 
information that hasn’t been adequately maintained, and users are justified in 
questioning the overall accuracy and currency of that information.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">Many tools are available to help writers improve the quality 
of their information by checking for spelling errors, grammar and punctuation 
problems, and other types of errors, such as invalid cross-references.</p>
                        <div class="heading">
                            <h4 id="ch04lev2sec11">Spell-checking tools</h4>
                            <p class="noindent">Probably the most common quality assessment tool is the 
spell-checking tool, which compares written content against a predefined list of 
terms and flags any terms that aren’t in the list as being misspelled.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p class="noindent">Spell-checking tools are useful, but they also have their 
drawbacks. For example, they can’t spot misspellings that result in a legitimate 
word (<em>to</em> vs. <em>too</em> or <em>most</em> vs. <em>moist</em>), and in 
most cases they can’t make up for lack of knowledge about commonly misused terms 
(<em>discreet</em> vs. <em>discrete</em>, <em>principle</em> vs. 
<em>principal</em>, or <em>loose</em> vs. <em>lose</em>).</p>
                        <p class="noindent">Nevertheless, spell-checking tools can eliminate most 
embarrassing typos and misspellings, so they are worth running, especially if 
you don’t have an editor or another colleague to check your work before it’s 
published.</p>
                        <p class="noindent"><a id="page_94"></a>The following sentence demonstrates the 
strengths and weaknesses of spell-checking tools:</p>
                        <div class="sidebar">
                            <hr width="100%" size="0" align="center" />
                            <p class="sidebarpara">The the plus sign is called a <em>binary</em> operater 
because of the use of two arguments, one argument one each side of the plus 
sign.</p>
                            <hr width="100%" size="0" align="center" />
                        </div>
                        <p class="noindent">This sentence contains several problems:</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingB">• The word <em>the</em> is duplicated, and the word 
<em>operator</em> is misspelled. Spell-checking tools would catch these two 
errors.</p>
                        <p class="indenthangingB">• The second instance of the word <em>one</em> should 
be spelled as <em>on</em>. Most spell-checking tools would not catch this type 
of error, which reaffirms the need to have information edited by a human editor 
and not just by automated tools.</p>
                        <p class="noindent">Most spell-checking tools also provide the ability to 
customize the terms that are checked, which means that you can add product and 
component names, obtuse technical terms, abbreviations, terms that your 
marketing department has decided to creatively capitalize, and any other terms 
that are specific to the subject matter that you document.</p>
                        <div class="heading">
                            <h4 id="ch04lev2sec12">Grammar-checking tools</h4>
                            <p class="noindent">Most authoring tools include some type of grammar-checking 
tool that can check for issues like passive constructions, negative 
constructions, gender-specific words, and even colloquialisms and jargon.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p class="noindent">Some conventions that grammar-checking tools flag might 
conflict with the guidelines that your organization follows, so be careful about 
blindly accepting all of the advice that these tools offer. Many of these tools 
allow you to customize the tool to match your organization’s standards. For 
example, the grammar-checking tool of one popular authoring program allows you 
to check for the use of the serial comma, which is a handy capability if your 
organization doesn’t use the serial comma.</p>
                        <div class="heading">
                            <h4 id="ch04lev2sec13"><a id="page_95"></a>Link-checking tools</h4>
                            <p class="noindent">A link checker verifies that the links in your content 
properly display a target page.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p class="noindent">The use of link checkers is most valuable as part of normal 
maintenance, to identify links that no longer display a page. There’s always a 
chance that the links that you add today might not work at all several months 
from now. Links become broken all the time, often simply because a company 
decides to reorganize or relocate their content. Therefore, you should check for 
broken links regularly so that you can find them before your users do.</p>
                        <div class="heading">

                            <p class="noindent">Providing your users with accurate technical information is 
one of the most important parts of your job. Users expect all of the information
