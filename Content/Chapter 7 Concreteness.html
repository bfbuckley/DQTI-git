<p class="noindent">When you document a complicated procedure, a new concept, or 
a default value for an input field, you can make that information more concrete 
by relating it to an experience, skill, or knowledge that users already possess. 
By using examples, scenarios, or even just precise terminology, you can provide 
specific and practical details that help your users truly understand the 
unfamiliar.</p>
<p class="noindent">What makes concreteness so important in technical writing is 
that many technical subjects, such as relational database access, inheritance 
among Java classes, and the effects of a chemical compound on the human nervous 
system, are abstract. People cannot experience abstract subjects directly, as 
they can with physical objects such as a building, a bicycle, or a cheeseburger. 
However, people can successfully master abstract concepts, terms, and ideas much 
more easily if they can relate those concepts, terms, and ideas to something 
real in their experience. Good writers look for ways to make abstract 
information more concrete.</p>
<p class="noindent">Writing concrete information, however, can be a challenge 
for a variety of reasons:</p>
<p class="head">Lack of subject knowledge</p>
<p class="uln-indent">You need experience with a subject to know what examples 
or scenarios to use and the creativity to recognize the possibilities for making 
<a id="page_216"></a>information more concrete. Writers often do not have time 
to master a subject, or the subject is complicated.</p>
<p class="head">Lack of knowledge about the audience</p>
<p class="uln-indent">You must also understand your audience well enough to 
choose concreteness elements that the audience can relate to. For example, an 
analogy that involves blueprints will likely resonate more effectively with an 
audience of civil engineers than it will with an audience of financial 
planners.</p>
<p class="head">Lack of resource</p>
<p class="uln-indent">Adding the elements that make information more concrete, 
such as examples, samples, or graphics, is often regarded as extra work, 
something to do after you write the basic information. You might choose not to 
include concreteness elements in an information plan or outline, and 
concreteness elements that are missing might not be so obvious during a review 
as a missing step or task. However, a lack of concreteness elements will 
definitely slow users down when they use the information.</p>
<p class="head">Added maintenance</p>
<p class="uln-indent">Writing concretely can be risky because something that is 
concrete, such as a detailed code example, is more prone to becoming inaccurate 
or dated than something abstract. Keeping concreteness elements up to date and 
relevant often requires regular maintenance. You must be willing to take this 
risk and employ strategies to reduce it.</p>
<p class="noindent">These challenges are worth overcoming because concrete 
information is so much more useful than abstract information. When elements of 
concreteness are used appropriately, they can improve all types of information, 
including traditional book-based information that consists primarily of task, 
concept, and reference topics; help topics; videos; and content that appears in 
a user interface, such as window titles, field labels, and error messages.</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of concreteness elements as tools in a writer’s 
toolbox. Just as a skilled carpenter knows which tool to use in certain 
situations, you must know when and where to apply the concreteness element that 
is appropriate for your audience and the information that you are writing. The 
concreteness elements that are available to you include:</p>
<p class="head"><a id="page_217"></a>Scenarios</p>
<p class="uln-indent">Scenarios are stories that are based on real-life 
situations that your users might encounter. Scenarios provide users with a 
big-picture perspective of complex task and overview information.</p>
<p class="uln-indent">A good scenario is based on users’ actual goals, skill 
level, and any other relevant factors. For example, a scenario might describe 
how an experienced systems architect can use several functionally related 
products together to achieve a business goal, such as strengthening a security 
environment or improving performance. Or a scenario might describe how a new 
user of a software application can get up and running quickly with the three or 
four most common functions of that application.</p>
<p class="uln-indent"><em><a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/gloss01.html#gloss_125">Scenario-based 
information</a></em> is not a concreteness element, but rather the output of a 
process in which information is designed and written to address specific 
scenarios. Before a single word of documentation is written or a single user 
interface window is coded, writers, technical experts, and usability engineers 
research how an audience will use a product or a technology in the real world. 
Based on the results of that research, scenarios are developed that will guide 
writers as they determine which types of information are required to meet users’ 
needs.</p>
<p class="uln-indent">For example, one scenario for a workplace safety program 
might reveal the three most common tasks that must be performed during a safety 
audit, as well as the typical experience level of the auditor. Based on that 
information, the writer can accurately determine which tasks need to be 
documented and can determine the appropriate level of detail for those 
tasks.</p>
<p class="head">Programmatic assistance</p>
<p class="uln-indent">Programmatic assistance eliminates the need for written 
information, which from your users’ perspective is a good thing. Programmatic 
assistance automatically performs tasks for your users. For example, when users 
select an option in a user interface entry field, other options that are related 
to the option that they selected can be automatically populated with default 
values. Users can then accept those default values, or they can provide values 
of their own. Instead of writing documentation about the values that your users 
need, you provide that information in the interface.</p>
<p class="head"><a id="page_218"></a>Examples</p>
<p class="uln-indent">Examples are perhaps the most common type of concreteness 
element. An example shows your audience one way to do something or describes a 
concept from a particular perspective. Your audience can then apply the example 
that you provided to help them complete their tasks. Examples can take many 
forms, such as a code snippet that users can modify or simply a sentence that 
begins with the phrase <em>For example</em>.</p>
<p class="head">Samples</p>
<p class="uln-indent">Samples that you provide with a product or technology 
enable your users to become productive as quickly as possible. A sample is a 
tangible object that users can interact with to complete a task. For example, 
many software products provide sample commands or applications that users can 
run unchanged to achieve a basic understanding of how things work. Users can 
then take those samples and modify them to complete their specific tasks.</p>
<p class="head">Similes and analogies</p>
<p class="uln-indent">Similes and analogies relate the unfamiliar to the 
familiar by means of comparison. A simile is a figure of speech that uses the 
words <em>like</em> or <em>as</em> to make a direct comparison, for example, 
“the central processing unit is like the human brain.”</p>
<p class="uln-indent">Analogies are usually used to explain more complex 
subjects or relationships. Analogies demonstrate how something or some set of 
things is similar to something that the user is familiar with, for example, “The 
environment consists of a processing unit (the brain), two types of storage 
(long-term memory and short-term memory), an input device (senses that are used 
to take in information, such as sight and hearing), and an output device (the 
sense of speech, the ability to write, nonverbal cues).”</p>
<p class="head">Visual elements</p>
<p class="uln-indent">Visual elements such as icons, illustrations, and the use 
of color, shading, and highlighting help users to quickly understand a piece of 
information that would otherwise require them to read text. For example, an 
illustration that depicts the many components of a software environment provides 
users with a visual understanding of that environment and saves users from 
having to read several pages of written information. Similarly, the use of red, 
yellow, and green status indicators in a user interface provides users with 
information about the health of their system without requiring them to do any 
unnecessary reading. The visual effectiveness guidelines explain how to 
effectively use visual <a id="page_219"></a>elements to make information more 
concrete. See <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch11.html#ch11">Chapter 
11</a>, “<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch11.html#ch11">Visual 
effectiveness</a>,” on page <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch11.html#ch11">421</a> 
for more information.</p>
<p class="head">Precise language</p>
<p class="uln-indent">Terminology can run the gamut from the abstract to the 
concrete, as shown in the following illustration:</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%207%20Concreteness_files/219fig01.jpg" width="663" height="182" /></div>
<p class="uln-indent">Using precise language requires a writer to be diligent 
about determining the most appropriate words and phrases for the intended 
audience. Using a word such as <em>resources</em> when you really mean 
<em>storage</em> or a word such as <em>power supply</em> when you really mean 
<em>120 volt AC adapter</em> can make information more abstract than it needs to 
be and even hide the meaning of that information. The lack of precise language 
can also impact clarity.</p>
<p class="noindent">In addition to making a product or technology more usable, 
concreteness elements such as examples, scenarios, and similes can help 
eliminate the dullness that many people consider typical of technical 
information.</p>
<p class="noindent">Because of the importance of scenarios, examples, and 
samples to users, this chapter emphasizes these means of achieving concreteness. 
This chapter also focuses on the quality characteristics (particularly task 
orientation, accuracy, clarity, and retrievability) that make scenarios, 
examples, and samples effective.</p>
<p class="noindent">To make information concrete, follow these guidelines:</p>

<div class="heading">
<h3 id="ch07lev1sec1"><a id="page_220"></a>Consider the skill level and needs of 
users</h3>
<p class="noindent">One challenge of providing useful concreteness elements is 
being able to satisfy an audience that consists of widely different skill levels 
(novice to expert), that has different needs (a casual user versus a power 
user), and that has different backgrounds (for example, cultural differences). 
As with all the guidelines in this book, the key principle is to <em>know your 
users</em>.</p></div>
<div class="heading">
<h4 id="ch07lev2sec1">Domain expertise</h4>
<p class="noindent">The most effective way to understand the needs of your users 
and to develop useful examples is to work with user data that you obtain from 
experienced users or that you obtain from colleagues who work directly with 
experienced users. The knowledge that these subject matter experts provide is 
called <em><a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/gloss01.html#gloss_34">domain 
expertise</a></em>, which is built up over years of experience with a product, 
technology, industry, or discipline. There is no substitute for domain 
expertise: it can’t be developed overnight, it can’t be gleaned from a book, and 
without it, you might have trouble developing examples that will help your users 
complete their tasks as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p></div>
<p class="noindent">For example, if you are writing a tutorial to help nurses 
learn how to use a new medical charting application, you would rely on somebody 
with expertise in the domain of healthcare. Most likely, that person will be a 
nurse, a medical records specialist, or a healthcare manager. These domain 
experts could provide you with realistic information about a patient’s 
temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and other vital signs that are required 
to make the tutorial as concrete as possible. Without input from a domain 
expert, you might be tempted to make your best guess about what a realistic 
blood pressure should be for a patient on a certain combination of medications. 
Or you might take the lazy approach and document the interface with unhelpful 
instructions such as “Enter the blood pressure in the <strong>Blood 
pressure</strong> field.” A domain expert could tell you precisely what a 
realistic blood pressure reading should be in that situation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Domain experts can also help you to write effective and 
useful examples, samples, and scenarios by helping you understand what users 
want and need to do with the technology that you are writing about. How do users 
prefer to interact with the technology? What are their goals? What criteria 
constitute a positive user experience? If you can obtain solid answers to these 
questions, you are well on your way to helping your users to be successful with 
your product.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_221"></a>Notice the level of detail in the 
<strong><a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/gloss01.html#gloss_39">Example</a></strong> 
section of the following parameter description:</p>
<p class="rev-head">Original</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<hr />

<p class="title">RESOURCE TIMEOUT</p>
<p class="sb-uln-indent">The RESOURCE TIMEOUT parameter controls the number of 
seconds that lapse before a resource is canceled.</p>
<p class="sb-uln-indentt"><strong>Range:</strong> 1 - 3600<br /><strong>Default 
value:</strong> 30<br /><strong>Example:</strong><![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]><code>RESOURCE 
TIMEOUT=60</code></p>
<hr />
</div>
<p class="noindent">The original example merely illustrates the proper syntax, 
which is fairly simple and likely obvious to most users. The user’s real need is 
knowing how to set this parameter appropriately for their situation, and only 
somebody with practical knowledge of this technology knows what the appropriate 
settings are for different situations.</p>
<p class="rev-head">Revision</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<hr />

<p class="title">RESOURCE TIMEOUT</p>
<p class="sb-uln-indent">The RESOURCE TIMEOUT parameter controls the number of 
seconds that lapse before a resource is canceled.</p>
<p class="sb-uln-indentt"><strong>Range:</strong> 1 - 3600</p>
<p class="sb-uln-indent"><strong>Default value:</strong> 30</p>
<p class="sb-uln-indent"><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<p class="sb-uln1">Use the following examples as guidelines when you initially 
establish timeout values. You likely will need to fine-tune these settings over 
time.</p>
<p class="sb-uln1"><strong>RESOURCE TIMEOUT=30</strong></p>
<p class="sb-uln1">Accept the default value of 30 for noncritical applications 
and applications that run multiple times during the day. Cancelations occur most 
often during peak usage periods, so applications that run multiple times during 
the day will likely be rerun during an off-peak usage period when system 
resources are more readily available and a timeout is less likely to occur.</p>
<p class="sb-uln1"><strong>RESOURCE TIMEOUT=180</strong></p>
<p class="sb-uln1">Use a value of 180 for applications that are run on an ad hoc 
basis, applications that are not mission critical, and applications that do not 
consume a high level of system resources. For example, 180 is appropriate for an 
application that generates reports.</p>
<p class="sb-uln1"><strong>RESOURCE TIMEOUT=360</strong></p>
<p class="sb-uln1">Use a value of 360 for mission-critical applications.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_222"></a>The revised parameter description 
contains several useful examples that get users a lot closer to completing a 
task.</p>
<div class="heading">
<h4 id="ch07lev2sec2">Skill levels of the audience</h4>
<p class="noindent">Depending on your audience, you might need to provide 
different examples and scenarios for different skill levels and about various 
subjects. An example that was written to address the needs of a novice 
data-entry clerk will almost certainly not be as useful to an experienced 
software administrator.</p></div>
<p class="noindent">For example, you might need to provide novice users with a 
scenario that helps get them up and running quickly with the most basic 
functions of a product. You also might need to provide experienced users with 
one or more scenarios to help them understand some of the more complex features 
or procedures of that same product.</p>
<p class="noindent">Users of new products and technologies always need examples 
and scenarios because all users will be unfamiliar at first. However, remember 
that novice users do not remain novice for long, so be cautious about devoting 
too much effort to documenting basic tasks and functionality. See the 
completeness guideline “<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch05.html#ch05lev2sec4">Provide 
appropriate detail for your users and their experience level</a>” on page <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch05.html#ch05lev2sec4">123</a> 
for more information about how to design information that meets the skill levels 
of your audience.</p>
<div class="heading">
<h4 id="ch07lev2sec3">Cultural backgrounds of the audience</h4>
<p class="noindent">Technical information in the twenty-first century can be 
accessed virtually anywhere by anybody who has a laptop or mobile device. 
Therefore, you should always assume that your information will be used by an 
international audience. When you write scenarios and examples, avoid using terms 
that are specific to your particular culture. For example, the terms 
<em>inch</em>, <em>dollar</em>, <em>social security number</em>, and <em>zip 
code</em> might not be relevant or familiar to a non-U.S. audience. Instead, use 
more culturally generic terms such as <em>centimeter, price</em>, and 
<em>identification number</em>.</p></div>
<p class="noindent">For more information about writing for a culturally diverse 
audience, see the style guideline “<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch08.html#ch08lev1sec3">Avoid 
gender and cultural bias</a>” on page <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch08.html#ch08lev1sec3">273</a>.</p>
<div class="heading">
<h3 id="ch07lev1sec2"><a id="page_223"></a>Use concreteness elements that are 
appropriate for the information type</h3>
<p class="noindent">The examples, samples, scenarios, and other concreteness 
elements that you provide must be appropriate for the type of information that 
you are writing.</p></div>
<p class="noindent">Users have different needs and expectations depending on the 
type of information that they are using. For example, a detailed code sample 
will be less useful in a high-level conceptual topic than it will be in a task 
or reference topic because users read conceptual information to gain broad 
understanding of a subject. They read task and reference topics to put that 
understanding into practice. Similarly, user interface elements have unique 
concreteness requirements.</p>
<div class="heading">
<h4 id="ch07lev2sec4">Embedded assistance</h4>
<p class="noindent">Embedded assistance is arguably the most important type of 
written content for those products that have user interfaces, which includes 
both software and hardware products and technologies. Because embedded 
assistance is so valuable to users’ productivity, you should strive to make it 
as concrete as possible.</p></div>
<p class="noindent">Embedded assistance elements are defined in “<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch01.html#ch01lev1sec1">Embedded 
assistance</a>” on page <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch01.html#ch01lev1sec1">4</a>. 
The following sections describe those embedded assistance elements from a 
concreteness perspective.</p>
<div class="heading">
<h5 id="ch07lev3sec1">Programmatic assistance</h5>
<p class="noindent">As described in the completeness guideline “<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch05.html#ch05lev1sec1">Make 
user interfaces self-documenting</a>” on page <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch05.html#ch05lev1sec1">101</a>, 
providing high-quality programmatic assistance is one of the biggest favors that 
you can do for your users. Programmatic assistance is more than simply providing 
a hint in an input field. You can increase the likelihood that your users will 
be successful with your product and will have a positive experience by including 
default values, automatically entering information or values for users so they 
don’t need to manually enter that information, and automatically completing 
input fields.</p></div>
<p class="noindent">Whenever you can choose between using programmatic 
assistance and using another type of embedded assistance, always use 
programmatic assistance. Programmatic assistance is the most concrete form of 
embedded assistance.</p>
<div class="heading">
<h5 id="ch07lev3sec2"><a id="page_224"></a>Text labels</h5>
<p class="noindent">Make text labels for user interface elements, such as input 
fields, radio buttons, and drop-down lists, as descriptive as possible so that 
users know exactly what they need to enter:</p></div>
<p class="rev-head">Original</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%207%20Concreteness_files/224fig01.jpg" width="661" height="229" /></div>
<p class="noindent">The field labels in the original example are vague. Users 
who need more information about these fields might be expected to click the help 
button to find what they need. But why send users to the product help when you 
don’t need to?</p>
<p class="rev-head">Revision</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%207%20Concreteness_files/224fig02.jpg" width="661" height="229" /></div>
<p class="noindent">A better solution is to provide more descriptive labels by 
using specific language, as shown in the revision. Notice that the purpose of 
the last input field has been broadened to address not only checking for 
dependencies, but also listing any dependent objects that are found.</p>
<p class="noindent">Unless you are restricted by space constraints that limit 
the number of characters that you can include in the interface, always use as 
much space as is needed to describe each user interface element. Notice also 
that the last field in the panel includes a default value. Most users will want 
to know about dependencies between these objects, and checking for these 
dependencies will do no harm, whereas not checking for dependencies can cause 
problems.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_225"></a>The purpose of some user interface 
elements, however, is so complex that a concrete text label on its own is not 
enough to help users specify the right value or make the right choice. In these 
situations, consider including an example that shows a correct value or choice. 
In the following dialog, an example is provided for the <strong>Subject or 
content</strong> field because users must enter a value that is difficult to 
explain through the text label alone and that must also follow a specific 
syntax:</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%207%20Concreteness_files/225fig01.jpg" width="535" height="350" /></div>
<p class="noindent">See “<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch07.html#ch07lev1sec8">Use 
specific language</a>” on page <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch07.html#ch07lev1sec8">256</a> 
for additional examples of how the careful use of text elements can improve 
concreteness in user interfaces.</p>
<div class="heading">
<h5 id="ch07lev3sec3">Messages</h5>
<p class="noindent">Messages that are displayed in the interface are useful for 
communicating things like the status of a task, the progress of an operation, or 
a value that was entered incorrectly or not at all. Because users typically care 
about messages only when something has gone wrong, it’s important to give them 
as many details about the error situation as possible.</p></div>
<p class="rev-head">Original</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%207%20Concreteness_files/225fig02.jpg" width="604" height="200" /></div>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_226"></a>The original message informs users that 
something is not right, but it doesn’t give them enough detail to correct the 
situation.</p>
<p class="rev-head">Revision</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%207%20Concreteness_files/226fig01.jpg" width="604" height="200" /></div>
<p class="noindent">The revised message describes the error from the users’ 
perspective and informs them specifically what has gone wrong. More importantly, 
it provides a specific action for them to take to correct the error on their 
own.</p>

<h5 id="ch07lev3sec4">Control-level assistance</h5>
<p class="noindent">Control-level assistance is help that is associated with a 
particular user interface control. Control-level assistance typically takes the 
form of tooltips or hover help. The following illustration shows two examples of 
control-level assistance: a tooltip for an icon and hover help for a radio 
button:</p></div>

<p class="noindent">The language in these elements must be concise and specific. 
Examples are extremely useful to help users understand the purpose of a user 
interface control and the effects of using that control, as demonstrated in the 
hover help for the <strong>Enable stemming</strong> radio button.</p>

<p class="sb-indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> Enter keywords and the

</div>
<p class="noindent">In the revised version, the example of output in the first 
step and the example of input in the last step help users know what to 
expect.</p>
<p class="noindent">You can’t provide an example for every step, and you 
shouldn’t need to. If users can see the actual interface while doing a step, 
they probably don’t need a screen capture of the interface.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_228"></a>Given time constraints, providing an 
example for every task is probably impossible and perhaps not desirable from the 
users’ point of view. How do you decide what tasks most need examples? You can 
consider certain characteristics of the tasks, as shown in the following 
figure:</p>
<div class="heading">
<div class="image"><a id="ch07fig01"></a><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%207%20Concreteness_files/07fig01.jpg" width="653" height="480" /></div>
<p class="fig-caption"><strong>Figure 7.1</strong> Criteria to consider when you 
select examples</p></div>
<p class="noindent">Focus particularly on the following kinds of tasks (as shown 
in the upper-right quadrant of the figure):</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Tasks that are complex or difficult</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Tasks that are important but performed 
infrequently</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Tasks that are critical to using the product</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Tasks that are new or that have changed</p>
<p class="noindent">How useful do you think the task example in the following 
step is?</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<hr />

<p class="sb-indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> Click <strong>Color &gt; Color 
<em>name</em></strong> to change the color of any of the windows. For example, 
click <strong>Color &gt; Red</strong> to make the window red.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_229"></a>The action in this step falls in the 
lower-left quadrant of the previous figure: it is extremely simple and probably 
not critical to using the product. Most users can likely get along just fine 
without it.</p>
<p class="noindent">The following step also involves defining a color scheme, 
but in a much more important context:</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<hr />

<p class="sb-indenthangingN"><strong>2.</strong> Define the characteristics of 
the different alert levels by adding the relevant parameters to the alert 
definition file. For example, you might define the following characteristics for 
the HIGH alert level like this:</p>
<p class="codelink"><a id="p229pro01" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch07_images.html#p229pro01a">Click 
here to view code image</a></p><p class="pre1">ALERT = HIGH (COLOR="RED", FREQ="30", SEND="ALL");</p>
<p class="sb-indenthangingNP">Based on this definition, high alerts will be 
displayed in red text on the console; they will be reissued every 30 seconds 
until the operator acknowledges the alert; and notifications will be sent to all 
personnel who are defined in the alert notification list.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Defining alerts that affect the health of a system is 
certainly considered a critical action. Although the syntax of the ALERT 
statement might not seem too complex, defining an alert incorrectly could result 
in serious problems. Also, users are not likely to define or change alerts 
frequently, which means that they’re unlikely to recall the details for 
completing this task when they do need to work with alerts.</p>

<h4 id="ch07lev2sec6">Conceptual information</h4>

<p class="sidebarpara">For example, when a car passes over a bump, the weight of

kinetic energy that is released when the springs decompress, therefore reducing 
the amount that the car bounces.</p>

detailed explanation of the cause of the problem helps users avoid making the 
same mistake again.</p>

required to make these types of improvements is sometimes outside the bounds of 
a writer’s expertise. Therefore, work with your technical experts to identify 
the concrete steps that help users to help themselves.</p>

<h4 id="ch07lev2sec9">Focused elements</h4>

is to help users make progress as quickly as possible. A short, well-focused 
code example can often replace multiple paragraphs that explain the syntax of a

when you include concreteness elements, try to pare them down to include just 
the information that is essential to the point that you want to make.</p></div>

<h4 id="ch07lev2sec10">Realistic elements</h4>
<p class="noindent">Users appreciate examples, samples, and scenarios that they 
can relate to and that reflect their goals. Consider the following guidelines 
when you create concreteness elements that try to meet your users’ needs:</p>
</div>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Use concreteness elements that pertain to the 
particular environment or circumstances in which the product or technology will 
be used. Also, consider common exceptions to the standard usage of a product or 
technology, for example:</p>
<p class="indenthangingBD">– If a software product will be used on thousands of 
similar workstations, make sure that any samples that you create are based on a 
large-scale implementation.</p>
<p class="indenthangingBD">– If an industrial chemical is affected by or 
performs differently in extreme heat or cold, make sure that your examples take 
these temperature differences into account. Don’t provide examples only for the 
median temperature.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Use <em>realistic</em>, rather than <em>real</em> 
data in examples, samples, and scenarios. Using real samples and examples can 
make your organization potentially liable if a sample or example causes problems 
with a user’s system. For example, performance data can vary widely depending on 
environmental considerations. If you use real performance data in an example and 
your users don’t experience the same performance benefits, your users might feel 
that they were misled.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Avoid the use of fictitious names of organizations 
in examples, samples, and scenarios because sometimes these fictitious names 
turn out to be real, and might even be the trademark of an organization. Instead 
of using a fictitious name, such as <em>XYZ Savings and Loan</em>, use a generic 
descriptive name instead, such as <em>a medium-sized regional bank</em>.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Similarly, don’t use fictitious web addresses. Even 
if a web address seems safe to use (that is, you checked it, and it doesn’t 
display a page), you can’t be sure that the web address won’t be used by 
somebody in the future. Instead, use one of the web addresses that have been 
designated by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) exclusively for use 
in examples. These web addresses are www.example.com, www.example.net, 
www.example.org, and www.example.edu.</p>
<div class="heading">
<h4 id="ch07lev2sec11"><a id="page_242"></a>Current elements</h4>
<p class="noindent">Concreteness elements can become outdated and inaccurate if 
they contain functions that are no longer supported. Code examples and samples 
can become outdated if they include items from popular culture or numbers (such 
as prices and dates). If you must include dates, try to make them far enough in 
the future that they won’t soon seem outdated. Consider how long the information 
must last.</p></div>
<p class="noindent">To reduce the work that is needed to maintain examples and 
samples, remove items that are likely to show their age quickly. Consider what 
item is likely to become dated in the following example and how you might change 
it:</p>
<p class="rev-head">Original</p>

<hr />
</div>
<p class="noindent">The original example uses a model name for a car, which is 
more likely to change or become obsolete than the manufacturer name, which the 
revised example uses.</p>
<p class="noindent">Whatever examples and samples that you use, be sure to make 
the explanatory text match the example or sample.</p>
<div class="heading">
<h3 id="ch07lev1sec4"><a id="page_243"></a>Use scenarios to illustrate tasks and 
to provide overviews</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>scenario</em> depicts a series of events over time, 
usually in the context of a fictitious but realistic set of circumstances. It 
shows one path through one or more tasks or products. A scenario can range from 
a high-level overview of the key benefits of using a product to a detailed 
explanation of the steps that are required to set up a complex hardware or 
software environment.</p></div>
<p class="noindent">You use scenarios primarily to teach (as in a tutorial) or 
to describe and motivate (as in marketing and technical overview 
information).</p>
<p class="noindent">Scenarios that are used to teach are referred to as <em>task 
scenarios</em>. Task scenarios provide users with a hands-on perspective of 
interacting with a product or technology and show how a product or technology 
can contribute to solving a larger business goal. Unlike the lists of steps in a 
procedure, task scenarios follow a story that depicts the actions in a real-life 
setting.</p>
<p class="noindent">Scenarios that are used to describe and motivate are 
referred to as <em>business scenarios</em>. Business scenarios focus on the 
application of one or more products or technologies to achieve a large or 
complex business goal, such as improving data security across a dozen different 
data centers in a dozen different countries. A business scenario can’t possibly 
address all of the steps that are required to achieve a complex goal, but it can 
illustrate different methods and approaches for reaching the goal and the 
benefits for pursuing one method or approach over another.</p>
<p class="noindent">To create an effective scenario, you need to create a scene 
with characters who have similar tasks or similar problems to those of your 
users. When you write scenarios, focus on goals that users are likely to want to 
achieve. Scenarios that are based on interesting and relevant goals are more 
helpful than those that focus on rarely used or esoteric features. You might be 
able to get ideas for scenarios from usability engineers who use scenarios for 
testing or from colleagues who demonstrate your product to customers.</p>
<div class="heading">
<h4 id="ch07lev2sec12">Task scenarios</h4>
<p class="noindent">Task scenarios are an effective way to illustrate how users 
can achieve a specific goal that requires them to complete multiple tasks or 
that requires them to choose between multiple options. Task scenarios truly make 
a task concrete by presenting it in a real-world context. The audience for task 
scenarios is typically the users of the product or technology.</p></div>

<p class="sidebarpara">In this lesson, you learn how to write an application to 
process data for more than one application server.</p>
<p class="sidebarpara">A major retail company periodically sends a copy of the 
employee table that is stored at headquarters to the regional branches. The 
application that you are writing needs to update the local copies. However, 
because a database manager can be connected to only one application server at a 
time, the application must manage the transfer of data.</p>
<p class="sidebarpara">An application can manage the transfer of data in one of

</div>
<p class="noindent">The revised passage presents a task scenario that puts the 
user in a realistic situation with a need to use the task information.</p>
<p class="noindent">If you simply add a thin story layer to what is still 
hard-to-understand information, as in the following topic, you haven’t created a 
real task scenario:</p>

<p class="title">Connection ID usage</p>
<p class="sidebarpara">In this scenario, a two-party call exists between party A 
and party B. The Make_Call from party A to party B results in connection IDs 
being generated to represent their participation in the call. Party A then 
issues an Extend_Call program call to extend the call to party C. The 
Extend_Call places party B on hold and results in two new connection IDs being 
created: one for party A’s connection in the new call (party ID 1) and one for 
party C (party ID 2). To join all three parties in a conference call, Party A 
issues a call to InfoConference and requests party ID 1 and party ID 2.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<p class="noindent">The original scenario might represent a real situation that 
users encounter with the telephone software, but it doesn’t represent how most 
people interact with the software. Users might need to read this narrative 
several times just to understand whether the parties in it are people and what 
they are doing. The manner in which this scenario is presented—a solid block of 
text that contains impersonal references such as party A and party B—also makes 
this scenario difficult to parse and understand.</p>

<p class="sidebarpara">Alice needs to set up a conference call with Subir and

connection IDs looks like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%207%20Concreteness_files/245tab01.jpg" width="393" height="67" /></div>
<hr />
</div>
<p class="noindent">The revised scenario clarifies the situation and the 
relationship between what the people do and what the software does in response. 
Scenarios can emphasize actions and actors without the imperatives that are 
usual in technical information. Writing scenarios is probably as close to 
narrative writing as writers of technical information get.</p>
<div class="heading">
<h4 id="ch07lev2sec13">Business scenarios</h4>
<p class="noindent">Unlike task scenarios, business scenarios describe each 
action at a very high level and do not provide the specific steps that are 
required to complete each action. Business scenarios are typically more 
conceptual than task scenarios. <a id="page_246"></a>Note that although business 
scenarios are commonly used to describe events in a business context, they can 
apply to other contexts as well, such as education and science.</p></div>
<p class="noindent">An effective use of business scenarios is in overview 
content that presents a broad set of information in a realistic setting. For 
example, business scenarios are ideal for demonstrating how multiple products 
can be used together to achieve a solution, which might require a database 
system, application server middleware, a network environment, and a mobile 
client device. Individual task and concept topics can be written to provide 
details for implementing what is described in the scenario. The audience for 
business scenarios is typically people who are involved with evaluating a 
product or solution to determine if that product or solution is appropriate for 
their organization’s business goals.</p>
<p class="noindent">The following passage comes from information for evaluating 
a product:</p>

<p class="sidebarpara">With a distributed relational database, you can benefit 
from accessing data as if it were located wherever you are.</p>
<p class="sidebarpara">Consider a large multinational insurance company with 
headquarters in one city and sales offices in many other cities around the 
world. Each sales office has a relational database for its own transactions, and 
each month the office must send data to headquarters for the sales summary 
report. By using a distributed relational database that merges the data from all 
of the sales office databases, headquarters can access the sales data 
directly.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<p class="noindent">The original passage leaves to the user’s imagination what 
the benefits might be. The revised passage presents a business scenario that 
illustrates a specific benefit that users can apply to similar situations.</p>
<p class="noindent">The scenarios that are used in this book as examples are 
necessarily brief. However, scenarios in technical information can be quite 
long, depending on the complexity of the goal that you are attempting to 
document. Scenarios that deal with the use of more than one product are 
particularly likely to be longer.</p>
<div class="heading">
<h3 id="ch07lev1sec5"><a id="page_247"></a>Make code examples and samples easy 
to use</h3>
<p class="noindent">Code examples and samples help users do their own work 
because users can copy the code or other content and adapt it to their own 
needs.</p></div>
<p class="noindent">Examples and samples in software information often contain 
code and commands. For example, a C++ routine does not describe C++ code; it 
<em>is</em> C++ code for a particular purpose. When you describe the C++ 
language, use examples of C++ code.</p>
<p class="noindent">Remember that you cannot provide an example or sample for 
everything, so when you prioritize which information would benefit from a 
related example or sample, focus on the most difficult, frequent, important, and 
new information.</p>
<p class="noindent">If your examples or samples are large sections of code, 
provide them online or as files with the product media rather than providing 
them only in the product documentation. Users must transcribe large code 
examples that are not online or included with the product before they can copy 
or adapt the code. Also, an advantage of including samples and examples online 
is that you can update them more easily; if they are included in printed 
information, they are more likely to become outdated due to the amount of time 
that it takes to publish a new version of printed information.</p>
<p class="noindent">When you provide examples and samples, include an 
appropriate level of instruction in comment lines. The following excerpt is from 
a sample installation response file, which is a tool that is used to install an 
identical instance of a program on many computers:</p>

<p class="noindent">The revision provides the following improvements over the 
original:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• A thorough description of the purpose of the 
sample</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Detailed instructions for modifying each section of 
the sample</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Descriptions of the attributes that users must 
specify</p>
<p class="noindent">Often, when you provide these three things, you can 
eliminate some or all of the task information that is related to a sample.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another important difference between the original and 
revision is how variables are presented. A <em>variable</em> is a placeholder 
that users must replace with their own value. The original version includes the 
variable <code>loc_rep</code>, which <a id="page_249"></a>is not presented in 
any way that indicates that it is a variable. Also, it is not named intuitively. 
How would users even know that this variable needs to be changed?</p>
<p class="noindent">In the revision, the variable has a more intuitive name of 
<code>local_repository</code> and is enclosed in less than and greater than 
symbols (&lt; and &gt;), which is a common convention for indicating variables. 
Alternative methods for indicating variables are the use of brackets ([ and ]) 
and braces ({ and }), which display correctly in all text editors.</p>
<p class="noindent">When you add comments to code examples and samples, consider 
where those comments will be most helpful—probably not far from what they’re

<p class="noindent">The revision includes an explanation of how this example can 
be used in other similar situations. It also describes the specific changes that 
are caused by running this example. By reading these descriptions, users can 
start to understand how they can use this example in their own work.</p>
<div class="heading">
<h3 id="ch07lev1sec7"><a id="page_253"></a>Use similes and analogies to relate 
unfamiliar information to familiar information</h3>
<p class="noindent">Comparing the unfamiliar with the familiar helps users 
easily understand new information.</p></div>
<p class="noindent">Similes and analogies are figures of speech that explicitly 
describe one thing in terms of another. Words such as <em>like</em>, 
<em>as</em>, and <em>as if</em> usually introduce similes and analogies. These 
figures of speech add color and interest as well.</p>
<p class="noindent">Some users, for example, might have difficulty understanding 
the concept of defragmenting a hard drive. However, if you explain that a hard 
drive can become like a set of encyclopedias that have been put back in the 
wrong order, and that defragmenting is the process that puts volume A at the 
beginning, followed by volume B, and so on, users can understand the concept 
(provided that they are familiar with encyclopedias, of course).</p>
<p class="noindent">When you use similes and analogies, make the basis of the 
comparison explicit. Avoid using metaphors, which are implied descriptions of 
one thing in terms of another.</p>
<p class="noindent">The following paragraph tries to explain a concept by using 
a simile:</p>
<p class="rev-head">Original</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<hr />

<p class="sidebarpara">A <em>class hierarchy</em> is a ranking of classes that 
shows their inheritance relationships. It looks like a tree.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<p class="noindent">However, a vague assertion about the similarity of a class 
hierarchy to a tree isn’t all that helpful. Various pictures of trees are likely 
to come to mind, but you don’t know why they might look like a class 
hierarchy.</p>
<p class="rev-head"><a id="page_254"></a>Revision</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<hr />

<p class="sidebarpara">A <em>class hierarchy</em> is a ranking of classes that 
shows their inheritance relationships. It resembles a tree because each class is 
represented by a single leaf, or <em>node.</em> Related classes are connected to 
each other by lines, which are referred to as <em>branches.</em> The single 
point into which all classes terminate is called the <em>root node.</em></p>
<hr />
</div>
<p class="noindent">The revised passage gives a reason for the suggested 
likeness. This situation could also be a good place to use a graphic to support 
the simile.</p>
<p class="noindent">Analogies are similar to similes but are usually longer. 
Rather than relying on one area of similarity, they tend to involve a larger 
relationship. Consider how an analogy might improve the following passage:</p>
<p class="rev-head">Original</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<hr />

<p class="sidebarpara">The Status view shows the current activity based on the 
amount of resource that each app that is running is using. Usage is expressed as 
one of three status codes.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<p class="noindent">The original passage states the facts but lacks a framework 
that users can relate to. This description might be enough for experienced 
users, but novice users might need more explanation to fully understand the 
significance of the Status view.</p>
<p class="rev-head">Revision</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<hr />

<p class="sidebarpara">The amount of concurrent activity on your device affects 
the performance of an app in the same way that traffic conditions affect the 
speed of cars. When traffic is light, cars reach their destinations quickly. 
Conversely, when traffic is heavy, cars take longer to reach their destinations. 
The Status view shows the traffic conditions for each app that is currently 
running. These conditions are expressed as the following status codes:</p>
<p class="title"><strong>Status code 1</strong></p>
<p class="sb-uln-indent">Traffic is light. The app is not experiencing any 
warning or severe conditions for network resources.</p>
<p class="title"><strong>Status code 2</strong></p>
<p class="sb-uln-indent">Traffic is heavy. The app is experiencing one or more 
conditions that are slowing it down. If you need this app to run more quickly, 
consider stopping any apps that are not critical.</p>
<p class="title"><strong>Status code 3</strong></p>
<p class="sb-uln-indent">Traffic is stopped. The app is experiencing one or more 
severe conditions that prevent it from running at an acceptable level. For this 
app to run, you must stop some of the other apps that are currently running.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_255"></a>The revised passage uses an analogy 
that many people can visualize and understand.</p>
<p class="noindent">Often technical information deals with subjects that are new 
to at least some users. If a subject is well understood by most users, no gap 
exists in their understanding, but you could choose to use similes or analogies 
to enliven the information.</p>
<p class="noindent">When you use similes and analogies, make sure that the items 
that you use in your comparison are familiar to your entire audience. For 
example, the simile “The numeric identifier is like a social security number” is 
relevant only to people who live in the United States. Also, avoid using idioms 
and colloquialisms because they are, by definition, particular to a discrete set 
of users. For information about using the right language to address different 
audiences, see the style guideline “<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch08.html#ch08lev1sec2">Convey 
the right tone</a>” on page <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch08.html#ch08lev1sec2">267</a>.</p>
<div class="heading">
<h3 id="ch07lev1sec8"><a id="page_256"></a>Use specific language</h3>
<p class="noindent">Technical discussions include both general language and 
specific language. General language is typically appropriate in overviews, 
summaries, and topic sentences, in which concepts and procedures are introduced. 
However, in detailed usage information, you need to weed out abstractions in 
favor of specific language.</p></div>
<p class="noindent">The following table provides just a few examples of abstract 
and general terms and phrases that, depending on the context, should be replaced 
by more concrete alternatives:</p>
<div class="heading">
<div class="image"><a id="ch07tab01"></a><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%207%20Concreteness_files/07tab01.jpg" width="831" height="464" /></div>
<p class="tab-caption"><strong>Table 7.1</strong> Abstract words and phrases and 
concrete alternatives</p></div>
<p class="noindent">The use of specific language is essential in user 
interfaces. When users work with an interface, they are trying to accomplish a 
task. By using specific language in the interface, you can prevent users from 
having to stop in the middle of the task to obtain needed information. The 
following window is a typical login dialog:</p>
<p class="rev-head"><a id="page_257"></a>Original</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%207%20Concreteness_files/257fig01.jpg" width="591" height="340" /></div>
<p class="noindent">Depending on the context, the experience of the user, and 
possibly other factors, the field labels <strong>Server</strong> and 
<strong>User name</strong> might not be specific enough. Perhaps users have 
several types of servers in their environment as well as unique user names for 
those different servers.</p>
<p class="rev-head">Revision</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%207%20Concreteness_files/257fig02.jpg" width="592" height="338" /></div>
<p class="noindent">Providing labels that are as specific and as meaningful as 
possible helps users to determine the appropriate values to enter. In the 
revision, users now have a much better idea about the server and user name that 
they need to enter. Note that in addition to providing a more precise name for 
the <strong>Server</strong> field, this field has been converted to a drop-down 
list of all available collaboration servers, which makes it even easier for 
users to complete their task. Changing the <a id="page_258"></a>title of the 
<strong>User name</strong> field to <strong>Server administrator user 
name</strong> makes it clear that only the server administrator can log in and 
use this application, which prevents users who aren’t administrators from 
wondering why they are unable to log in.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another way to increase specificity in a UI is to include 
<em>input hints</em> directly in the UI, like the ones that are provided for the 
following input fields:</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%207%20Concreteness_files/258fig01.jpg" width="589" height="309" /></div>
<p class="noindent">These hints depict the specific format for the values that 
users enter in the <strong>SJPL ID number</strong> and <strong>PIN</strong> 
fields, so users have a pretty good understanding of the values that they need 
to provide. Also, note that no description is provided for the <strong>Your 
name</strong> field because it’s safe to assume that all users will understand 
what they need to type in this field.</p>
<div class="heading">
<h3 id="ch07lev1sec9"><a id="page_259"></a>Concreteness checklist</h3>
<p class="noindent">When you document a procedure, a concept, an input field in 
a user interface, or any other technical subject, you can make the information 
that you write more concrete by relating it to an experience, skill, or 
knowledge that users already possess.</p></div>
<p class="noindent">By using examples, scenarios, programmatic assistance, 
similes and analogies, graphic elements, and precise terminology that your users 
can relate to, you are increasing their chances for success. Users are much more 
proficient when they have a solid understanding of the information that they are 
using.</p>
<p class="noindent">You can use the following checklist in two ways:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• As a reminder of what to look for, to ensure a 
thorough review</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• As an evaluation tool, to determine the quality of 
the information</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%207%20Concreteness_files/259tab01.jpg" width="832" height="610" /></div>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%207%20Concreteness_files/259tab01a.jpg" width="831" height="400" /></div>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_260"></a>To evaluate your information for all 
quality characteristics, you can add your findings from this checklist to <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/app01.html#app01">Appendix
