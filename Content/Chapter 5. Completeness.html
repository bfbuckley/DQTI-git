<p class="indenthangingB">• Each subject is covered in sufficient detail</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• All promised information is included</p>
<p class="noindent">Ensuring that your information is complete involves more 
than checking items off of a list—it starts with building the right list of what 
to include. You need to understand the purpose of the information that you are 
creating, for example:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Who is your audience?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• What is your audience’s level of expertise?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• What goals are they trying to achieve?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• What tasks do they complete to achieve those goals 
within your specific tool or product?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• What tasks do they complete to achieve those goals 
before or after they use your tool or product?</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_100"></a>Too often, technical writers create too 
much information about subjects that are not important and not enough 
information about what matters to users. If you write from a technical 
specification, you can easily write too much about how the product is 
constructed, which users don’t need to know. If you follow old paradigms for how 
to deliver information, such as one help topic for each product window, you end 
up writing a lot of information that no one wants or needs to read. Instead, 
when you consider the goals of your audience and the tasks that they need to 
complete to reach those goals, you can discern which content matters to them and 
which content does not.</p>
<p class="noindent">Delivering complete information is not a balancing act 
between adding too much information and not providing enough. Instead, through 
task analysis and by using the product, you learn exactly what information users 
need and when they need it. If you provide a help topic to explain each field in 
a window and no hover help for those fields, the information can seem incomplete 
because the information is not where the user needs it. Providing information in 
the wrong context makes it irrelevant. See the organization guideline “<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch09.html#ch09lev2sec2">Separate 
contextual information into the appropriate type of embedded assistance</a>” on

to learn more about where information is the most effective.</p>
<p class="noindent">As you learn what your users need, you add, subtract, and 
move information. Before you deliver your product, doing usability tests can 
help you identify where you have written too much information, where information 
is missing, and whether the information is where users expect it. After you 
deliver your product, you can monitor page hits and common searches to determine 
what users are looking for the most.</p>
<p class="noindent">To make information complete, follow these guidelines:</p>

<div class="heading">
<h3 id="ch05lev1sec1"><a id="page_101"></a>Make user interfaces 
self-documenting</h3>
<p class="noindent">Before writing one word of topic documentation, make sure 
you are a part of the team that designs the user interface so that you can help 
ensure that it is as easy to use and intuitive as possible. Even if users don’t 
read the topic documentation, they will always see and use the interface. One 
word or one change in an interface can save pages of documentation, which too 
often serves to “fix” deficiencies in the interface.</p></div>
<p class="noindent">In an ideal situation, your user interface is based on the 
same scenarios as your documentation. When user interfaces are developed from 
scenarios, users are guided through tasks when appropriate so that they can stay 
on task and accomplish their goals. Scenario-driven design also ensures that 
interactions for common tasks are kept to a minimum.</p>
<p class="noindent">For complicated scenarios that include tasks that are 
completed outside of the user interface, a wizard might provide instruction for 
those tasks and then assist users with completing the tasks that are inside of 
that particular user interface. For example, installation wizards often end with 
instructions for additional configuration steps or even open the next 
application or tool to complete that configuration.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_102"></a>The following tool can benefit from 
more focus on design that supports the main usage scenario:</p>
<p class="rev-head">Original</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%205.%20Completeness_files/102fig01.jpg" width="706" height="486" /></div>
<p class="noindent">A common task in login interfaces is changing your password. 
If you look carefully at the original user interface, the only mention of 
password is in the drop-down list from the <strong>Connect</strong> button, a 
list which is itself hard to find.</p>
<p class="noindent">The window includes a named section, 
<strong>Settings</strong>, which seems like it might offer some links for this 
task, but that task is not included in that section. Only by reading the help do 
you discover how to access the Change Password dialog—by selecting 
<strong>Connect and prompt for user ID and password</strong> from the 
<strong>Connect</strong> list.</p>
<p class="rev-head"><a id="page_103"></a>Revision</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%205.%20Completeness_files/103fig01.jpg" width="706" height="487" /></div>
<p class="noindent">The redesigned user interface supports this common task, 
adding <strong>Change Password</strong> as a permanent link under the 
<strong>Connect</strong> button. Other ways to update this interface might 
include adding a <strong>Change Password</strong> link under <strong><a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/gloss01.html#gloss_145">Tasks</a></strong> 
or changing the <strong>Connect</strong> list choice to <strong>Connect and 
Change Password</strong>. Any of these changes could save confusion and extra 
documentation.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_104"></a>After the user interactions are ideal, 
you can provide additional support for users without ever writing a word by 
incorporating programmatic assistance, as described in the following table:</p>
<div class="heading">

<p class="noindent">This field includes what looks like a default value, but it 
is actually an example. Likely, users won’t realize it’s an example and will 
attempt to accept the default and move to the next window. Then, they’ll get an 
error message that states that the field value is not correct. Note also that 
the field is grey, and it’s not clear how to edit the field so that you can 
change the portion that must be changed <code>(infodb_server:port)</code> to 
make the address functional.</p>

<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%205.%20Completeness_files/106fig02.jpg" width="713" height="122" /></div>
<p class="noindent">In the revision, the example string is below the field and 
labeled as an example. Users can refer to it as they type in the field, which is 
no longer grey.</p>
<p class="noindent">By starting with the user interface and bringing your skills 
as a writer to the design of the user interface, you help your team to improve 
the product experience. More importantly, you help users by reducing the amount 
of separate documentation they have to read and keeping them where they want to 
be—in the product, completing their tasks.</p>
<div class="heading">
<h3 id="ch05lev1sec2"><a id="page_107"></a>Apply a pattern for disclosing 
information</h3>
<p class="noindent">To ensure that you cover all of the relevant information, 
apply a pattern for structuring your information.</p></div>
<p class="noindent">“<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch01.html#ch01lev1sec1">Embedded 
assistance</a>” in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch01.html#ch01">Chapter 
1</a> and the organization guideline, “<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch09.html#ch09lev2sec2">Separate 
contextual information into the appropriate type of embedded assistance</a>,” 
introduce patterns and, in particular, a pattern for progressively disclosing 
information starting from the user interface. Following a <em>pattern</em> for 
progressive disclosure helps you determine where to put information so that it 
follows a natural progression and is exactly where users need it, when they need 
it.</p>
<p class="noindent">Before you can apply the pattern, you need to know what 
assistance capability is available in your user interface so that you can define 
the pattern. Work with your team while the user interface is being designed to 
ensure that the necessary assistance capabilities are available to support 
embedded assistance. The following list provides several important capabilities 
to plan for:</p>
<p class="head">Static text</p>
<p class="uln-indent">Ensure that you can insert static inline text when it’s 
necessary. Determine the maximum length for static text and whether you can 
include highlighting and links.</p>
<p class="head">Tool or icon assistance</p>
<p class="uln-indent">Determine how to display tool or icon assistance. In most 
web user interfaces, tool or icon assistance is provided as tooltips from the 
browser, which display in small yellow boxes. These tooltips usually have a 
maximum length of two to three words.</p>
<p class="uln-indent">Ensure that tooltips can be turned off if necessary. 
(Tooltips and hover help are defined in the <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch01.html#ch01">Chapter 
1</a> section “<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch01.html#ch01lev1sec1">Embedded 
assistance</a>” on page <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch01.html#ch01lev1sec1">4</a>.)</p>
<p class="head">Control-level assistance</p>
<p class="uln-indent">Determine how you can provide user interface control-level 
assistance. In web user interfaces, control-level assistance is provided most 
often as hover help. If this capability is not available, decide what mechanism 
you can use instead. Determine the maximum length for control-level 
assistance.</p>
<p class="uln-indent">Test whether you can provide hover help only for certain 
controls and not other controls. Because you don’t need to provide hover help 
for all controls, you might want to use an icon, for example <span class="middle"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%205.%20Completeness_files/example.jpg" width="16" height="15" /></span>, to indicate where hover help is included.</p>
<p class="uln-indent">Many teams want to enforce consistency by requiring hover 
help on all controls, which leads to a great deal of unnecessary help and a <a id="page_108"></a>counterproductive customer experience. Most controls can and 
should be clear simply from their labels or any default or example values. Users 
do not want to see windows full of <span class="middle"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%205.%20Completeness_files/example.jpg" width="16" height="15" /></span> icons or with lots of hover help opening when 
they move their pointer around the interface.</p>
<p class="uln-indent">Ensure that tooltips and hover help are not applied to the 
same user interface controls.</p>
<p class="head">Linking</p>
<p class="uln-indent">Verify that you can link from the user interface to 
separate contextual help topics, if necessary. You need a way to send users to 
help for additional information that will not fit within the user interface, as 
described in the retrievability guideline “<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch10.html#ch10lev1sec2">Guide 
users through the information</a>” on page <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch10.html#ch10lev1sec2">394</a>.</p>
<p class="head">Messages</p>
<p class="uln-indent">Identify the various message display mechanisms, for 
example, dialogs, message status bars, and log windows. Determine how much text 
you can include and whether you can incorporate links. With your team, redesign 
message dialogs to accommodate all parts of the message, for example, the 
message text, explanation, and user response.</p>
<p class="noindent">The following message dialog has a <strong>Learn 
more</strong> link, which opens a help topic:</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%205.%20Completeness_files/108fig01.jpg" width="645" height="491" /></div>
<p class="uln-indent"><a id="page_109"></a>The only difference between the 
information in the dialog and the information in the help topic is the user 
response, which instructs users how to correct the problem. If the message 
dialog could display all of the message information, users would not have to 
click the link and be frustrated with this duplication. Instead, they could stay 
on task and fix their problem. Incorporating the full message into the message 
dialog not only solves the completeness problem of duplication, but also 
addresses the organization guideline “<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch09.html#ch09lev1sec1">Put 
information where users expect it</a>” and the retrievability guideline “<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch10.html#ch10lev1sec3">Link 
appropriately</a>.”</p>
<p class="head">Help display</p>
<p class="uln-indent">Determine how and where linked help information will 
display. Not all assistance can fit within the user interface itself, so decide 
whether the assistance will display in an embedded help pane within the product 
or in a separate window or browser page.</p>
<p class="noindent">After you have an idea of what assistance capabilities are 
available, you can define a pattern for progressively disclosing information 
such as the pattern in the following table:</p>
<div class="heading">
<div class="image"><a id="ch05tab02"></a><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%205.%20Completeness_files/05tab02.jpg" width="831" height="517" /></div>
<p class="tab-caption"><strong>Table 5.2</strong> Sample pattern for 
progressively disclosing information in a user interface</p></div>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_110"></a>By following a pattern, you can see 
where in the user interface you can provide certain information, should it be 
necessary. The word <em>necessary</em> is key because you should not clutter a 
user interface with information just because you have a map for where to put it. 
Instead, approach each window, command, or piece of hardware as if you can find 
a way to make it clear with no words at all. Often doing this work means working 
with usability engineers and product developers to adjust the design so that the 
user interactions will be more obvious and require less explanation, as 
described in the guideline “<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch05.html#ch05lev1sec1">Make 
user interfaces self-documenting</a>.”</p>
<p class="noindent">For example, does the user interface provide too many ways 
to navigate, such as tabs, breadcrumbs, a navigation tree, and a 
<strong>Next</strong> button? When the flow of tasks through the interface is 
streamlined, assistance can be briefer because you don’t need to waste time 
explaining how to move around the interface for each task. After you are certain 
that the interactions are as clear as possible, add only the minimum number of 
words that are needed to make the interactions clear.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_111"></a>The following example shows an 
application that is not progressively disclosing messages:</p>
<p class="rev-head">Original</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%205.%20Completeness_files/111fig01.jpg" width="647" height="675" /></div>
<p class="noindent">The original message includes multiple problems. It 
duplicates the message information in a message dialog and at the top of the 
window, a completeness issue, and provides too little specific information to 
solve the problem, a completeness and concreteness issue. Most importantly for 
this particular error, the message itself is missing some essential information: 
it does not indicate the name of the directory that does not exist. In addition, 
the user interface does not mark the field that caused the error, and so it does 
not provide an entry point as described in the retrievability guideline “<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch10.html#ch10lev1sec4">Provide 
helpful entry points</a>.”</p>
<p class="rev-head"><a id="page_112"></a>Revision</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%205.%20Completeness_files/112fig01.jpg" width="649" height="503" /></div>
<p class="noindent">In the revised example, the writer worked with the usability 
engineer and product developers to eliminate the redundant error message display 
(the pop-up window) and to add an error icon next to the field that caused the 
error. Now the message text can remain as it is and work for either directory 
field, and the error icon on the field helps to pinpoint the problematic 
field.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_113"></a>When you follow a well-designed pattern 
for disclosing information in a user interface, users can more efficiently 
interact with the product. For example, the following user interface does not 
conform to its pattern for progressively disclosing information:</p>
<p class="rev-head">Original</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%205.%20Completeness_files/113fig01.jpg" width="638" height="353" /></div>
<p class="noindent">The hover help includes an example of syntax, but that 
example disappears when users move their pointers away from the hover help. 
Providing examples in hover help means that users must repeatedly go back and 
forth between the field and hover to get their syntax right.</p>
<p class="rev-head"><a id="page_114"></a>Revision</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%205.%20Completeness_files/114fig01.jpg" width="656" height="352" /></div>
<p class="noindent">In the revised user interface, the example text has been 
removed from the hover help and added below the field in grey text so that users 
can see it while they enter values in the field.</p>
<p class="noindent">As described in the organization guideline “<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch09.html#ch09lev1sec1">Put 
information where users expect it</a>,” when information is in the wrong place, 
users either won’t see it or won’t be able to use it and stay on task. Let your 
pattern help you determine where information should go and look for places to 
add information or take information away.</p>
<div class="heading">
<h3 id="ch05lev1sec3"><a id="page_115"></a>Cover all subjects that support 
users’ goals and only those subjects</h3>
<p class="noindent">Before you decide what subjects to cover, you must identify 
your users, evaluate their goals, and determine the tasks that those users need 
to do with your product to meet their goals. By knowing your users and their 
goals, you know what subjects are relevant.</p></div>
<p class="noindent">Both <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch01.html#ch01">Chapter

on users’ goals</a>” explain the difference between goals and tasks and the 
importance of understanding users’ goals. Users complete tasks to achieve their 
goals, and if you focus only on tasks, you might omit important information. 
Placing too much emphasis on tasks is somewhat like trying to describe how to 
build a fence by writing information only about how to use a hammer. To write

<div class="heading">
<h4 id="ch05lev2sec1">Create an outline or topic model</h4>
<p class="noindent">When planning what to write, you often either create an 
outline or build a topic model for the information about your product, whether 
your product is a software application, piece of hardware, or a training 
seminar. At a minimum, you must cover the major tasks, their subtasks, the 
reasons or conditions for doing them, and how to respond to expected errors.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">Avoid setting the boundaries of your model at what tasks can 
be done with your product because users don’t use products in isolation. 
Although you might be writing documentation for a television, you will frustrate 
users if <a id="page_116"></a>you do not write about how to hook the television 
up to their cable box and recording and playback equipment, as shown in the 
following topic model:</p>
<p class="rev-head">Original</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%205.%20Completeness_files/116fig01.jpg" width="769" height="321" /></div>
<p class="noindent">Most often, missing information is related to the gaps 
between products or outside of products. If you focus too closely on 
<em>what</em> you are documenting, you might create artificial boundaries around 
the information so that it describes only what happens within one product or 
even within a single window. Users can’t see how it all fits together.</p>
<p class="noindent">The easiest way to focus on user goals and avoid missing 
important tasks is to base your topic model or outline on user scenarios. 
Analyze your model to ensure that it includes the necessary content for users to 
achieve their goals regardless of how or with what tools they achieve those 
goals. Determine what tasks and subtasks your users will need to do. Some of 
this content might belong in a user interface, and some might end up as 
topic-based information. At this early stage, you are trying to get a high-level 
view of how users accomplish their goals and where your product fits in.</p>
<p class="noindent">Start the model from the users’ goals and the scenarios for 
achieving them, for example, how to watch movies on the television. Users often 
must complete steps in different products or tools. For example, to set up a 
television, users might need to assemble a TV stand and connect cables for other 
devices.</p>
<p class="rev-head"><a id="page_117"></a>Revision</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%205.%20Completeness_files/117fig01.jpg" width="650" height="561" /></div>
<p class="noindent">Ideally, enlist real users to validate both your 
understanding of their goals and of your topic model. Tell users all of the 
assumptions you made when you developed the scenario and model so that they can 
validate or correct your assumptions as well.</p>
<p class="noindent">For example, you might be documenting for novices a product 
with a sophisticated text search feature and assume that the users won’t 
understand search terminology such as <em>stemming</em>. During testing, you 
might learn that these users, though novices with your product, are not novices 
to searching or search terminology because they use LexisNexis products to do 
intensive searching as part of their jobs. With this information from real 
users, you can adjust your scenarios and models to provide the information that 
users actually need: how to take what they know about searching into the context

<h4 id="ch05lev2sec2"><a id="page_118"></a>Include only information based on 
user goals</h4>
<p class="noindent">The following welcome page in a product shows how easy it is 
to lose sight of users’ goals and write too much about product function or about 
how to use the information, for example, how to click links to open a 
wizard:</p></div>

<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%205.%20Completeness_files/118fig01.jpg" width="500" height="392" /></div>
<p class="noindent">The welcome page tasks focus on the tool and building a 
profile instead of actual user goals. The profile saves settings for the tool so 
that users don’t need to enter settings repeatedly. The profile is really a 
convenience mechanism but is being treated as if it was the entire goal of work 
in the tool. Users are getting a lot of information about the profile and no 
information about their real tasks.</p>

<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%205.%20Completeness_files/119fig01.jpg" width="500" height="392" /></div>
<p class="noindent">By contrast, the revision reorients the welcome page to the 
real user tasks: configuring an area of their system or updating a previously 
configured area. The users get the information they need about configuring their 
system, with the information about the profile reduced to its rightful place: as 
a convenience mechanism for saving settings.</p>
<p class="noindent">Throughout the project cycle, refer to your scenarios and 
topic models to evaluate whether your information covers the necessary subjects, 
and continue to validate your work with users. Ask users:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Are all the major tasks covered that users need to 
achieve their goals?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Are all the subtasks described that users need to do 
to complete the major tasks?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Are necessary steps outside of the tool 
referenced?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Are all the reasons or conditions explained that are 
associated with optional tasks?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Are problems anticipated and solutions 
described?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Are any described tasks insignificant or needed by 
only a small subset of users?</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_120"></a>The following task model shows a 
typical set of installation tasks:</p>
<p class="rev-head">Original</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%205.%20Completeness_files/120fig01.jpg" width="614" height="435" /></div>
<p class="noindent">If users use the InfoClient by itself, the set of tasks 
seems complete. However, the scenarios for InfoClient indicate that this client 
will almost always be installed on systems that include many or most 
prerequisite products rather than installed on new systems where no other 
products are installed.</p>
<p class="rev-head"><a id="page_121"></a>Revision</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%205.%20Completeness_files/121fig01.jpg" width="550" height="663" /></div>
<p class="noindent">The revision adds the tasks for installing on an existing 
system, including previously missing tasks such as determining whether the 
existing system includes the correct prerequisites. This topic model shows how 
easy it is for writers who focus only on their own product and not on the users’ 
goals or context to make assumptions that shortchange users. Always rely on 
thorough scenarios, grounded in users’ goals and validated with users, rather 
than your own assumptions.</p>
<div class="heading">
<h4 id="ch05lev2sec3"><a id="page_122"></a>Make sure concepts and reference 
topics support the goals</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes you need to explain concepts as you introduce a 
subject, explain a process, or highlight benefits. Do not confuse concepts with 
information about how a product is built. Concepts help users to learn because 
they provide necessary vocabulary and context for what users are doing. For 
example, most communications protocols consist of multiple layers; however, 
users don’t need to understand the detailed function of each layer to configure 
their router.</p></div>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, reference information must support the tasks. For 
example, details about command parameters that provide context about using the 
command to complete a task are useful, but details about how the command 
parameters got their names are not. Unnecessary reference information is the 
most likely type to bloat your information set because it’s easy to fall into 
the trap of documenting each field and variable, even those that are 
self-evident.</p>
<p class="noindent">Before you write conceptual or reference information, ask 
yourself what users will do with the information. For example, will the 
information help users make a decision or do the task at hand? When users are 
configuring access control in a product, they probably need to understand the 
overall security model so that they know how each selection affects other 
choices. They don’t need to know about preferences such as font size or full 
screen versus split screen windows. Information that isn’t relevant to the 
users’ task can frustrate and confuse users.</p>
<div class="heading">
<h3 id="ch05lev1sec4"><a id="page_123"></a>Cover each subject in only as much 
detail as users need</h3>
<p class="noindent">After you know the subjects that you need to write about to 
address users’ goals, you then need to decide how much detail to provide. You 
need to include enough detail for users to do their tasks but no more detail 
than they need. While you’re analyzing tasks in the context of users’ goals, you 
might not be able to anticipate all the details of a task. When you’re writing, 
the details will become obvious.</p></div>
<p class="noindent">Judgments about the completeness of detail are usually more 
subjective than judgments about which topics to include. For example, deciding 
whether to include a topic about “What’s new in this release” is easy, but 
determining which features are worth highlighting is not.</p>
<p class="noindent">To ensure that each subject includes only as much detail as 
users need:</p>

<div class="heading">
<h4 id="ch05lev2sec4">Provide appropriate detail for your users and their 
experience level</h4>
<p class="noindent">Too much detail is frequently the result of writing to more 
than one type of user or to no particular user at all. Sometimes extra detail is 
included for the secondary audience, which can distract the primary audience. 
For example, many tasks can be completed by using more than one method, but 
documenting both methods in the same topic can be confusing for the users of 
each method.</p></div>
<p class="noindent">The terms <em><a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/gloss01.html#gloss_105">primary 
audience</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/gloss01.html#gloss_129">secondary 
audience</a></em> refer to the readers of a book or topic; these readers are a 
subset of all of your product users. If you are writing a tutorial, your primary 
audience consists of novice product users, and your secondary audience consists 
of more experienced product users who, for example, need to learn about a new 
function. Typically, you make these distinctions as you analyze your audience 
and design your information.</p>
<p class="noindent">If your information has a secondary audience ask the 
following questions:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• How large is that audience?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• How (and how much) does the secondary audience 
differ from the primary audience?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Is the document that you’re writing the only source 
for this type of information for that secondary audience? Can the information 
for the secondary audience be omitted or moved elsewhere?</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_124"></a>The following passage shows 
installation information for a product that users can install by using a 
graphical interface or by using a command line. Presumably, most users will 
install the product by using the graphical interface and its embedded 
assistance. Command-line users, although a minority of product users, are the 
primary audience for the topic-based information in the following example:</p>

<p class="title">Configuring an Infolnstaller control point</p>
<p class="sidebarpara">To configure an Infolnstaller control point, you can use 
either the graphical program (InfinstGUI) or the command line (InfinstCMD).</p>

<hr />
</div>
<p class="noindent">The revised passage shows that two separate procedures 
address different users. The primary audience is not burdened with information 
that is directed at the secondary audience because users in the secondary 
audience can access the information that they need while they are using the 
graphical interface.</p>
<p class="noindent">This pair of topics shows an important distinction between 
the primary audience for certain information and the primary users of certain 
product functions. When information has a specialized audience that is different 
from most users of the product, ignoring that majority or relegating them to a 
secondary position can be difficult. The revised topic acknowledges the majority 
of product users (the secondary audience for this information) and directs them 
elsewhere. Thereafter, the information targets its primary audience, who use the 
command line.</p>
<p class="noindent">After you identify your audience or audiences, you must then 
investigate further. For example, you need to answer the following 
questions:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Are your users experienced or inexperienced with 
your product or with similar products?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Do you need to help novice users get up and running 
quickly but also help experienced users complete more complex tasks?</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Are the tasks something experienced users do 
infrequently, meaning that they might need more detail than for tasks that they 
do often?</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_126"></a>Knowing the experience level of your 
audience helps you determine what information is relevant.</p>
<p class="noindent">Be careful when determining how much focus you place on the 
needs of novices. Audiences and technology change over time, so do not emphasize 
the needs of novice users at the expense of experienced users. Novices do not 
remain novices for long—in fact, they might be novices only the first time they 
use the product that you are writing information for. As a result of this, you 
need to weigh how much focus you put on true novices, who are likely to need 
material directed at them only for a very short time.</p>
<p class="noindent">Think about the technology changes you’ve personally 
experienced. If you’re old enough, you remember when the mouse was new and users 
took a few moments to understand how to get the pointer to move across the 
screen if they ran out of table surface over which to move the mouse.</p>
<p class="noindent">You might think about when web browsers or smartphones were 
new. How long did it take you to pick up the essential techniques you needed to 
use those devices to accomplish your goals? As you were learning to use these 
new technologies, so was everybody else. And because you were all going through 
this learning curve together, you were able to share what you learned with your 
colleagues, friends, and family. Latecomers to a technology benefit from the 
early adopters, who can show them how to get started. Technical documentation 
that focuses only on the needs of the true novice is of value for a limited 
time.</p>
<p class="noindent">Writing about a product is easiest when your audience is 
homogeneous—either all experienced or all inexperienced. On one end of the 
spectrum, if your information is about a new product, you can assume that your 
audience is made up of novices, at least with this product. On the other end, if 
your information is about a well-established product that’s been on the market 
for a long time and sells to relatively few new users, you can assume that most 
of your audience is experienced.</p>
<p class="noindent">The challenge that writers frequently face is to 
successfully write to several different levels of experience. You don’t want to 
make assumptions that cause <a id="page_127"></a>major problems for novices. You 
don’t want to bog down experienced users with lots of introductory information, 
as in the following topic:</p>

<p class="noindent">The revised passage removes the unnecessary detail for users 
who know how to use the system but still need a reminder for the general flow of 
steps, locations, and command names.</p>
<p class="noindent">The following figure provides a general guideline for the 
level of detail that you should provide for different types of tasks and 
audiences. Novices are unlikely to pay much attention to advanced tasks. 
However, when novices complete advanced tasks they need “do this, do that” 
instructions rather than in-depth conceptual framework and detail that they 
won’t understand because they don’t have context for it. They need more detail 
for basic tasks and more conceptual framework so that they can build their 
knowledge and experience. Experienced users are bogged down by basic tasks and 
extra detail for basics, but they prefer extra detail for advanced tasks to help 
build their understanding of how pieces fit together.</p>

<p class="fig-caption"><strong>Figure 5.1</strong> Novice and experienced users 
need different detail levels for the same tasks</p></div>
<p class="noindent">If your audience has a mix of experience levels, you need to 
decide how to satisfy varied information needs without causing problems for any 
group. These are some approaches that you might take for your topic-based 
information:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Create separate topics for different experience 
levels. Link between the topics so that users can get what they need on request, 
regardless of their experience level.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Put the information into two different formats, such 
as advanced tasks for experienced users and tutorials or video tours for 
novices.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Within a single information set, segregate the basic 
topics from the advanced topics.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Integrate the information, but graphically 
distinguish between information for different experience levels. For example, 
provide labeled tips or shortcuts for experienced users. Use this approach with 
caution; make sure that you don’t end up with tasks where every step is labeled. 
A good rule of thumb is to completely separate information if more than a 
quarter of it requires a label for differentiation.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB"><a id="page_130"></a>• Programmatically customize 
information by audience type so that users see only the information that is 
relevant to them. For example, prompt users to answer questions and then return 
the information that meets their needs. Installation material can benefit 
greatly from customization because of the number of possible pathways through 
the information. For more information about using conditional coding in 
DITA-sourced documentation to customize content, see <em><a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/gloss01.html#gloss_33">DITA 
Best Practices</a>.</em></p>
<p class="noindent">For embedded assistance, you do not have the luxury of 
providing alternative information. Instead, identify a sweet spot between the 
two experience levels—somewhere a bit beyond the novice users and a bit below 
the experienced ones—and write to that experience level. Provide links from 
embedded assistance to advanced topics and provide links from advanced topics to 
more basic information, as described in the retrievability guideline “<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch10.html#ch10lev1sec2">Guide

<h4 id="ch05lev2sec5">Include enough information</h4>

<div class="heading">
<h5 id="ch05lev3sec1">Provide information about what users <em>should</em> 
do</h5>
<p class="noindent">You need to write the right information to help users 
succeed. You also need to provide the necessary information to help them when 
something goes wrong.</p></div>
<p class="noindent">Rather than focusing on what users <em>can</em> do within a 
user interface, focus on what they <em>should</em> do. <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch01.html#ch01">Chapter 
1</a> introduced the concept of domain expertise, and it is described in more 
detail in the concreteness guideline “<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch07.html#ch07lev1sec1">Consider 
the skill level and needs of users</a>” on page <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch07.html#ch07lev1sec1">220</a>. 
Domain expertise involves incorporating recommendations from experts in your 
documentation. One common example is field help that offers a range of possible 
values. While knowing the range is important, users still might not know what 
value is the best to choose for their situation without a recommendation from 
someone with experience. For example, how long should purchasers be allowed to 
hold tickets before purchasing them on an event website?</p>
<p class="noindent">Suppose that you’re documenting a product for performing 
legal analysis on large numbers of stored documents, including email. Because 
users of this product often need to assess thousands of documents, they need to 
be as efficient as possible. Tips for how to quickly move from document to 
document with as few clicks as possible are exactly what these users need.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_131"></a>Focus on the most likely questions 
users will have in their context. Users want information about how they can 
accomplish their goals in their environment. This type of information is the 
most difficult to discover, but it is often the most valuable for users. Your 
users don’t have access to the expertise that you have access to. They don’t 
have access to your development team, your support team, or those who help 
customers install and configure systems. When you write this type of material, 
you are like a reporter, asking questions of multiple experts and synthesizing 
the results to give users access to the expertise they’re looking for.</p>
<p class="noindent">That expertise can also help when you need to include 
information about what users should do when something goes wrong. The following 
topic provides some good information to show how users determine whether they’ve 
properly started the tool.</p>

here to view code image</a></p><p class="pre">The InfoExporter is not started. Make sure you have write<br />access to the /bin directory and read, write, and execute<br />access to the installation directory.</p>
<p class="noindent">Be careful, however, as you assess the need to document 
uncommon situations. Often those who develop and test a technology want to 
document every possible uncommon occurrence, but many of these cases are so rare 
that they shouldn’t be part of the information. Remember that you are writing 
documentation for users to accomplish their goals, not a legal document to 
protect your company from users’ mistakes.</p>
<div class="heading">
<h5 id="ch05lev3sec2">Include complete instructions</h5>
<p class="noindent">When you research instructions that you plan to write, 
follow every possible path in scenarios, including paths that lead outside a 
tool or application. Consider which of those paths, if any, require 
documentation that isn’t provided by the related tool or product. Documentation 
often stops at the boundary of a tool or product with sentences like, “For more 
information about widgets, see InfoWidget information.”</p></div>
<p class="noindent">Seemingly practical concerns, for example, that the related 
product is developed by another company, do not need to stop you from testing 
the full path to ensure that any critical information that users need is 
available. If you’re pointing to another set of information, users must be able 
to find what they need there.</p>
<p class="noindent">When you focus on users’ goals, you realize that 
accomplishing those goals often takes users to many different windows within a 
single application, to many different tools, and sometimes to steps that they 
complete outside of any tool or application. By focusing on the goals and 
scenarios and then testing procedural steps across the required tools, you 
quickly discover the gaps and assumptions that aren’t explicit.</p>
<p class="noindent">These gaps are even more obvious with hardware. For example, 
suppose your mailbox post is broken. You buy a new post for the existing 
mailbox. The instructions for the post explain how to install the new post, 
including the mounting board for a mailbox, but they do not explain how to mount 
the mailbox. A search on the company’s website turns up instructions for your 
mailbox, but these explain only how to install the latch and flag onto the box, 
not how to install the mailbox on the post. Both the post and mailbox 
instructions are complete for their piece, but your goal is to have a 
functioning mailbox, not a new post with a mailbox on the ground next to it.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_134"></a>Keep the goals of your users in mind to 
avoid such situations. You can do several things to facilitate complete 
instructions:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Consult with the team or writers who document the 
related parts or tools to decide how and where each of your information sets 
will talk about or link to the other.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Read the information for the related products or 
tools as it relates to your product or tool. Make sure that, if possible, each 
set of information acknowledges the other and that transitions between the two 
sets make sense for users coming from each direction. If the related product is 
owned by another company, make sure your information is clear about what 
information users need from the related documentation. As described in the 
retrievability guideline “<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch10.html#ch10lev2sec9">Use 
effective wording for links</a>” on page <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch10.html#ch10lev2sec9">409</a>, 
it is not enough to say, “See the documentation that came with your video 
camera” if supported video cameras do not provide any information about your 
television.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Build an overall procedural map for achieving a 
given user goal. In the following example, upgrading a case management system 
called InfoManager is a user goal. You can use a procedural map for your own 
planning purposes, or you can publish it for users. Although the particulars of 
these maps aren’t pertinent here, you can see procedures that start from two 
different starting points but arrive at the same finishing point: an upgraded 
system. The procedure at right includes two additional steps at the beginning 
for users who must upgrade their underlying platform system:</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_135"></a><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%205.%20Completeness_files/135fig01.jpg" width="500" height="525" /></div>
<p class="noindent">The procedures in these topic models are relatively 
straightforward, but many procedures can be much more complex, with many 
decision points. Tracking the instructions down each path will help you ensure 
that you provide complete instructions.</p>
<p class="noindent">If you publish flow diagrams like these for users, you can 
also make them into image maps that link directly to the pertinent topics. As 
described in the visual effectiveness guideline “<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch11.html#ch11lev2sec2">Illustrate 
significant tasks and concepts</a>” on page <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch11.html#ch11lev2sec2">431</a>, 
illustrations are a great way to orient users during complex procedures. Users 
can refer to the graphic at different times in the procedure, orienting 
themselves to where they are in the current complex flow.</p>
<div class="heading">
<h4 id="ch05lev2sec6"><a id="page_136"></a>Include only necessary 
information</h4>
<p class="noindent">Too much information also creates problems of 
completeness:</p></div>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Unnecessary details slow down users, making 
information that users need more difficult to find and use.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Unnecessary information can also annoy users, for 
example, when products confirm all decisions, even those that aren’t 
destructive. Imagine that you select all checked out library books to renew them 
and then see a confirmation message asking, “Do you want to renew the selected 
items?” There’s no disadvantage to renewing them all if you didn’t mean to do 
it. However, potentially destructive actions, such as deleting, reformatting, or 
exiting without saving should always be confirmed.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Additional information adds to your team’s 
development and maintenance costs.</p>
<p class="noindent">The idea that you can create information that is overly 
complete relates directly to the minimalist approach to technical writing. This 
approach was described by John Carroll in his 1990 book, <em>The Nurnberg 
Funnel: Designing Minimalist Instruction for Practical Computer Skill</em>:</p>
<p class="uln-indent">The key idea in the minimalist approach is to present the 
smallest possible obstacle to learners’ efforts, to accommodate, even to 
exploit, the learning strategies that cause problems for learners using 
systematic instructional materials. The goal is to let the learner get more out 
of the training experience by providing less overt training structure.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although Carroll originally focused on learners and 
tutorials, his techniques have been applied more broadly to other forms of 
information.</p>
<p class="noindent">Often, too much information confuses users by making it 
difficult to decide what is important. The following topic maps out information 
that is obvious in each mobile environment.</p>
<p class="rev-head"><a id="page_137"></a>Original</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<hr />

<p class="title">Mobile browser simulator overview</p>
<p class="sidebarpara">The mobile browser simulator is a web application that 
helps you test mobile web applications without having to install the device 
vendor native SDK. You can use the Mobile Browser Simulator to preview mobile 
applications on Android, iPhone, iPad, BlackBerry 6 and 7, Windows Phone 7, 
Windows Phone 8, and mobile web application environments.</p>
<p class="sidebarpara"><strong>Tip:</strong> When you preview a mobile 
application on an Android, iPhone, iPad, BlackBerry 6 and 7, Windows Phone 7, or 
Windows Phone 8 environment, only the devices for the selected environment are 
available. For example, if you preview a Worklight application on an Android 
environment, you can select only from the list of available Android devices. 
When you preview a Worklight application on a mobile web application 
environment, you can select from the list of available Android, iPhone, iPad, 
BlackBerry 6 and 7, Windows Phone 7, and Windows Phone 8 devices.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<p class="noindent">The original topic lists all mobile environments in the 
introductory paragraph, in the tip, and again in the examples in the tip. Not 
only is this a potential accuracy problem (as mobile environment release levels 
change), but it also makes the information longer than it needs to be. More 
importantly, it does not help users because the simulation choices that are 
available depend on the mobile environment.</p>
<p class="rev-head">Revision</p>

<p class="title">Mobile browser simulator overview</p>
<p class="sidebarpara">The Mobile Browser Simulator is a web application that 
helps you test mobile web applications without having to install the device 
vendor native SDK. You can preview mobile applications on Android, iPhone, iPad, 
BlackBerry 6 and 7, Windows Phone 7, Windows Phone 8, and mobile application 
environments.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<p class="noindent">The revised passage excludes the tip, which in this case is 
extraneous, and it efficiently tells users what the simulator is and which 
environments they can use it in.</p>
<p class="noindent">You might have noticed an additional change to the revised 
passage: the second sentence was shortened to remove the repetition of the 
component name.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_138"></a>Many introductions to topics contain 
more detail than users need, as in the following topic that describes the 
accessibility features of a product:</p>
<p class="rev-head">Original</p>
<div class="sidebar">

<p class="sidebarpara">You can also erase characters by pressing the long key, 
called the Spacebar, at the bottom of the keyboard. However, the Spacebar erases 
by going forward from where the cursor is.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<p class="noindent">The original passage includes too many details, both textual 
and graphical, about how to use a standard keyboard. Unless this is a product 
that teaches users how to type, these details are extraneous. The graphical 
elements break a related visual effectiveness guideline, “<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch11.html#ch11lev1sec2">Use 
graphics that are meaningful and appropriate</a>,” by illustrating what is 
clearly obvious to keyboard users.</p>

<p class="noindent">The revised topic tells users what keys to use to enter data 
in a window, but it excludes unnecessary details.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_139"></a>In user interfaces, too much 
information in the wrong place can detract from the usability of the product, as 
shown in the following web page:</p>
<p class="rev-head">Original</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%205.%20Completeness_files/139fig01.jpg" width="598" height="440" /></div>
<p class="noindent">In this web page, the introductory information pushes down 
the main content of the page, which is the file list. To do the main task on the 
page, working with files, users must scroll, or worse yet, page forward. The 
behavior of the introductory box is problematic, but it also includes 
information that is redundant or unnecessary for the context, for example, 
“Files is the new peer-to-peer file sharing component of InfoConnections.” This 
last sentence is marketing language that isn’t appropriate for an audience that 
has already purchased the product, but this type of information creeps into user 
interfaces and documentation, especially when products are new.</p>
<p class="rev-head"><a id="page_140"></a>Revision</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%205.%20Completeness_files/140fig01.jpg" width="598" height="440" /></div>
<p class="noindent">In the revision, the introductory section includes a close 
button (the X in the upper-right corner) so that users can dismiss the 
introductory text after they’re comfortable with the information. The static 
text has been shortened to remove redundancy, the marketing material, and the 
extra heading, none of which added value.</p>
<div class="heading">
<h3 id="ch05lev1sec5"><a id="page_141"></a>Repeat information only when users 
will benefit from it</h3>
<p class="noindent">Repetition can be helpful in many situations, but it can 
easily become a problem in others.</p></div>
<div class="heading">
<h4 id="ch05lev2sec7">Helpful repetition</h4>
<p class="noindent">Use repetition to:</p></div>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Orient users when they jump from another context, 
for example, from a link in a user interface to help content</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Appropriately emphasize and reinforce important 
points</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Eliminate the need for users to branch to another 
topic or page</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Provide information in different forms to support 
accessibility</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_142"></a>Review the following user interface 
dialog and portion of an associated help topic:</p>
<p class="rev-head">Original</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%205.%20Completeness_files/142fig01.jpg" width="650" height="646" /></div>
<p class="noindent">The original help topic contains no repetition, so the users 
of the help topic see examples of the minus sign but not how or where to enable 
it.</p>
<p class="rev-head"><a id="page_143"></a>Revision</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%205.%20Completeness_files/143fig01.jpg" width="650" height="646" /></div>
<p class="noindent">The revised passage includes the necessary information about 
the minus sign rather than forcing users to figure out from the examples what 
the minus sign does and how to access it in the user interface. You wouldn’t 
want to copy everything from another information source. However, don’t send 
users to a new context without providing some repetition to orient them.</p>
<p class="noindent">As with a change of context from the user interface to 
linked help, you also need to consider the transitions between products or 
tools. All products that you document work with other products, and individual 
products often consist of multiple different tools or applications. Because of 
this, you might need to repeat details about another tool or product in the 
context of your own tool or product. Situations such as these call for a 
discerning use of repetition: explain <a id="page_144"></a>to users only what 
they need and hide what they don’t need so that they can stay on task within 
their current context.</p>
<p class="noindent">Use repetition to reinforce important information, such as 
when a product or technology doesn’t behave as users might expect. In these 
cases, you document the exceptional behavior and then remind users of the 
exception in relevant locations in your information.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another important usage for repetition is to save users from 
needing to follow a link unnecessarily, something that happens often between 
products, but also within a single product’s documentation. On a mobile device, 
following links can cause you to needlessly lose your context, as shown in the 
following topic:</p>
<p class="rev-head">Original</p>
<div class="sidebar">

<p class="sidebarpara">Choose <strong>Save</strong> to test the server 
connection. After the verification step is complete, the server will be saved 
and the My Rooms view will display, which shows all the rooms you currently own 
or manage on the new server.</p>
<p class="sidebarpara"><strong>Important:</strong> You might receive the 
following warning:</p>
<p class="codelink"><a id="p144pro01" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/developing-quality-technical/9780133119046/ch05_images.html#p144pro01a">Click

<hr />
</div>
<p class="noindent">In the original topic, a link is provided to a separate 
topic for how to handle the warning about the security on the server. Users must 
follow the link, which is even more of a problem because they’re on a mobile 
device.</p>
<p class="rev-head">Revision</p>

<hr />
</div>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_145"></a>In the revised topic, the 
troubleshooting information is included so that users can immediately go to the 
settings and make the change they need to get back on task.</p>
<p class="noindent">A final case for repetition is related to accessibility: you 
might need to deliver information in more than one format or location for 
different audiences. For example, a video tour might be great for most of your 
audience, but visually impaired users won’t benefit from it. They need access to 
that information, so you must provide the same information as a script that they 
can listen to by using a screen reader. The script should explain exactly what 
is happening in the video tour so that they can imagine the interactions that go 
with the scripted words.</p>
<div class="heading">
<h4 id="ch05lev2sec8">Unnecessary repetition</h4>
<p class="noindent">Repetition is bad when it does not provide necessary 
information; extraneous details waste reading time and might give a wrong 
impression about what is important.</p></div>
<p class="noindent">Embedded assistance is particularly prone to the problem of 
too much redundant information, even though there’s so little room available for 
assistance. One contributor to this problem is that the user interface sometimes 
requires or enforces a certain amount of assistance out of a mistaken notion of 
consistency.</p>
<p class="noindent">For example, many user interfaces are coded to require hover 
help on all controls or no controls rather than allowing writers to 
appropriately pick the controls that require more explanation. When you can’t 
negotiate a change <a id="page_146"></a>to the technology, you might end up 
writing redundant assistance to fill the provided space, as shown in the 
following hover help:</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%205.%20Completeness_files/146fig01.jpg" width="649" height="431" /></div>
<p class="noindent">This practice has several unfortunate consequences:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Writing teams waste time and are often confused 
about what to write, so they write redundant hover help.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Testers waste time testing additional 
assistance.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Translators waste time and money translating 
unnecessary text.</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• Most importantly, users learn not to bother with 
hover help because there’s nothing useful there.</p>
<p class="noindent">When you repeat information unnecessarily, you not only 
interrupt and delay the users’ task, but you might also confuse users and waste 
space—especially in mobile interfaces, where space is very limited.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_147"></a>The hover help for the following field 
shows how you can fill space with redundant information without answering users’ 
questions:</p>
<p class="rev-head">Original</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%205.%20Completeness_files/147fig01.jpg" width="667" height="240" /></div>
<p class="noindent">The field label is clear about the fact that notifications 
are received by email, but users are left wondering what notifications are. The 
hover help, rather than answering this essential question, repeats the 
information from the field label both in its title and first sentence. The 
second sentence is interesting new information, but it is obscured by the 
redundant information.</p>
<p class="rev-head">Revision</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="Chapter%205.%20Completeness_files/147fig02.jpg" width="667" height="241" /></div>
<p class="noindent">The revised hover help eliminates the space-consuming title 
and the information that is redundant with the label. Instead it answers the 
essential question about notifications and then provides the additional helpful 
detail from the original hover help.</p>
<div class="heading">
<h3 id="ch05lev1sec6"><a id="page_148"></a>Completeness checklist</h3>
<p class="noindent">When you know your users and what they are trying to 
achieve, you can determine both the right information to provide and the right 
amount to provide.</p></div>
<p class="noindent">From the user’s point of view, completeness means that all 
of the required information is available, beginning with the information in any 
user interfaces. Well-designed user interfaces, which include helpful embedded 
assistance that follows a pattern of progressive disclosure, can reduce the 
amount of separate information that users need to achieve their goals. 
Information is complete when it covers all of the subjects that users need to 
understand to successfully achieve their goals. Complete information describes 
subjects at the right level of detail for the audience and the audience’s 
experience level.</p>
<p class="noindent">You can use the following checklist in two ways:</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• As a reminder of what to look for, to ensure a 
thorough review</p>
<p class="indenthangingB">• As an evaluation tool, to determine the quality of 
the information</p>
